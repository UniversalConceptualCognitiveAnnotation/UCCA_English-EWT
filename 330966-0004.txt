I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself , but when I had to listen to a ( non-violent ) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours , my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
