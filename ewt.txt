001325-0001	Highly recommended
001325-0002	My 8 year old daughter loves this place.
001325-0003	The best climbing club around.
001325-0004	Hooray for Craggy.
001961-0001	Buyer Beware!!
001961-0002	Rusted out and unsafe cars sold here!
001961-0003	Have a real mechanic check before you buy!!!!
001961-0004	Save money and go somewhere else!
002288-0001	It's well cool. :)

002317-0003	thank you
003418-0001	Billing Issues...
003418-0002	I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail.
003418-0003	My insurance company, Blue Cross/Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine.
003418-0004	Then I got a bill for $483.00.
003418-0005	The doctor's office said that payments had been "reversed".
003418-0006	Blue cross has no record of aa reversal.
003418-0007	The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC/BS.
003418-0008	They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter.
003418-0009	I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid, but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $160.00 has come through.
003418-0010	It was an ingrown toenail.
003418-0011	How much could it possibly cost?
003418-0012	Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe, the office staff is rude to boot.
003418-0013	I think this office has some serious billing practice issues!
004540-0001	They really go above and beyond!
004540-0002	For example, I actually forgot to feed my cat, and they went out of their way to take care of him.
004540-0003	Additionally, when there was confusion (my fault), they left me flowers along with a personalized gift.
004540-0004	They have been 100% reliable and professional.
004540-0005	Definitely recommend!
004574-0001	Over-rated...
004574-0002	This restaurant is over-rated.
004574-0003	It is hard to find...and the mexican food is bland, almost equivalent to eating out of a can.
004574-0004	The service is poor...
004574-0005	I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas...and did not get it.!
004574-0006	Secondly, the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce..but chili...like Hormel's chili..the cheese was American cheese!
004574-0007	The Chili Relleno..had no batter on it.
004940-0001	We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards, posters, etc.
004940-0002	We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started.
004940-0003	They have the best rates and GREAT customer service.
004940-0004	On one order, we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state.
004940-0005	They did that with no problem.
004940-0006	I also appreciate their honesty.
004940-0007	I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was.
004940-0008	They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect.
004940-0009	They recently surprised me a larger order.
004940-0010	I ordered 1000 postcards, we normally order 5000 or more.
004940-0011	Because they had room to do 5000, they created the larger amount, and shipped them early.
004940-0012	I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate!
004940-0013	They have a customer for life in us!
005265-0001	good
005265-0002	it is a cute little nice and quiet library
005636-0001	I LOVE MY GYM!
005636-0002	FITNESS UNLIMITED is a second home to a lot of us gym members who work out daily.
005636-0003	If you are serious about working out in a non-commercial like atmosphere then you have chosen the best place to be.
005636-0004	This is the most humble gym you will every step into.... if you dare to work on your body don't be surprised when you see how addicting going to FITNESS UNLIMITED can be!!
005760-0001	OK Food, Slow service
005760-0002	The food was incredibly bland.
005760-0003	Their Thali was not brought out as described (no saag).
005760-0004	Expensive for the level of food and the quality of service.
006970-0001	Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating.
006970-0002	We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked.
006970-0003	We were told that we couldn't today because they were closing soon.
006970-0004	I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in.
006970-0005	They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit.
006970-0006	I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone.
006970-0007	They refused.
006970-0008	Terrible communication as well.
006970-0009	At one point they told me the dog had been fixed, the next day it hadn't.
006970-0010	Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure.
007403-0001	My counseling practice
007403-0002	Hello my name is Vera and I'm writing a review about my own counseling practice in Bellevue, WA. and in Renton WA.
007403-0003	I am a licensed mental health counselor and I work with variety of mental health problems.
007403-0004	I offer compassionate, approachable and personalized counseling services.
007403-0005	My style is compassionate, nonjudgmental, and caring.
007403-0006	Please visit my website to learn more about my practice at www.veraakulov.com.
007403-0007	I am a preferred provider with most insurance companies.
007403-0008	Schedule your first appointment online!
007403-0009	I would appreciate reviews from anyone who has worked with me before in the mental health setting.
008585-0001	The best there is in service.
008585-0002	I was recently traveling down I-24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro.
008585-0003	It was 4:50 when a friend told me to call Bud, he would take care of me.
008585-0004	Not only did they answer the phone at 4:50 on a Thursday, they hit the ground moving!.
008585-0005	They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it, then they came out, took off my tire (it was a runflat - but runflats don't do you any good if they blow out), and brought it to their shop to change the tire.
008585-0006	They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6:30 that evening.
008585-0007	Thanks Bud for all of your help and taking time away from your family that evening.
008585-0008	It's without a doubt, the best service experience I've ever had and just to be clear, the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville's price for putting on the other rear tire.
008585-0009	I hope I can return the favor in the future!
008585-0010	Alan Grissom
008635-0001	Good food and very friendly staff.
008635-0002	Very good with my 5 year old daughter.
008635-0003	Interesting good value wine list to.
008635-0004	Beer a bit expensive.
009389-0001	gone
009389-0002	library is closed.
009389-0003	it is now bislas.
009596-0001	awful awful awful
009596-0002	This store is by far the worst Verizon store I've been in.
009596-0003	The salespeople are never available, the lines are always too long, and all the people want is a sale.
009596-0004	Incredibly rude and I will not return to it.
009596-0005	Is there no other Verizon to go to around Downtown/Dupont Circle1?!?!?
009775-0001	Want a great burger?
009775-0002	The smokehouse can't be beat anywhere.
009775-0003	Salad bar is hit and miss for freshness - sometimes the broccoli looks browned around the edges.
009775-0004	Never a bad smokehouse burger though!
009775-0005	I crave those.
009943-0001	such a great idea this was, so easy to load and pack, no ramp, no step up no back aches.
009943-0002	moving with a pod was the best moving experience i have had.
009970-0001	BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER!!!
009970-0002	It was the best Chinese food I have ever had.
009970-0003	All the food tasted excellent, and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom, it is awesome.
009970-0004	The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly.
009970-0005	Every time I go, Kevin, the manager, will always remember my family and I.
009970-0006	Overall, it is very family oriented, and I recommend it to everyone!!!
010378-0001	Poor Experience
010378-0002	I did not have a good experience w/ Dr. Ghassemlou.
010378-0003	During the session, he demanded to have my physical address, which I've always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program.
010378-0004	I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons, however, he did not adequately explain this during our session.
010378-0005	I learned more about this doing my own research afterward.
010378-0006	I think he could've done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts.
010378-0007	Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful.
010378-0008	It's pretty combative actually.
010393-0001	Auto Towing is one of the best towing services I have used.
010393-0002	The first time I used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination I needed.
010393-0003	The auto mechanics that work for Auto Towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question I had.
010393-0004	They have towed car for me a few times and I am always very satisfied with this services.
010393-0005	If you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service, then Auto Towing is the company for you.
010433-0001	Food good, service poor
010433-0002	No silverware, asked for a spoon for my sons mac and cheese ended up having to use my tea spoon.
010433-0003	Asked for bar-b-que sauce never got it.
010433-0004	Never checked back with us once we got our food.
010433-0005	Had to go the the bus boys station ourselves to get napkins.
010433-0006	Only one server, too buys talking with others I guess.
010433-0007	Food was good, but service means a lot to me.
010450-0001	As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food.
010450-0002	However, I still like this place a lot.
010450-0003	Esp. the mole, tortilla soup, and guacamole.
010450-0004	Margaritas are alright.
010450-0005	My only complaint is the QUESO.
010450-0006	It used to be fabulous, why did you guys change it??
010450-0007	Queso should not be watery :( .....
010450-0008	***update*** NEVER MIND!
010450-0009	They fixed the queso!
010450-0010	Thankyouthankyou
010820-0001	The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn, but advertised all over NY/NJ, including Fort Lee.
010820-0002	When the guys arrived (2 hours later than agreed) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $100 for them to drive back from your destination.
010820-0003	That was not in agreement eather, but they realy demand it.
010820-0004	And another $100 for wrapping the furniture.
010820-0005	So totalling $212 just for start before any work started.
010820-0006	Guess what, was not in the initial agreement as well.
010820-0007	I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track (from 2pm-8pm).
010820-0008	The only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2, I should admit, nothing was broken.
010820-0009	So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially.
010820-0010	One more thing, they don't take any credit cards or checks.
010820-0011	You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination.
011257-0001	It was a Saturday and my spring was broken...
011257-0002	I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh-so pleasant and helpful!
011257-0003	She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday!
011257-0004	I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair.
011257-0005	I enjoyed speaking with Dan, and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors.
011257-0006	The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair.
011257-0007	I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors.
011257-0008	Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service.
011257-0009	Roger M., Woodinville
011806-0001	absolutely fantastic experience getting my iphone upgraded at Zion ...
011806-0002	Sheer contrast to getting it done at karol bagh which is done under the wooden plank
012047-0001	Very knowledgeable and friendly design build firm.
012047-0002	They specialize in financial institutions, medical, and retail projects.
012047-0003	These guys know what they're doing and helped me in all phases of our project.
014483-0001	Poor Service
014483-0002	After firing this company my next pool service found the filters had not been cleaned as they should have been.
014483-0003	I would recommend not using this company.
014629-0001	There is no delivery.
014629-0002	There is no delivery.
014764-0001	Daniel and his assistant both did a great job.
014764-0002	Very professional and great results.
014764-0003	Many thanks from myself and all of our wedding guests!
015148-0001	This place has the best baby and childrens clothes.
015148-0002	Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just cant find in a lot of stores.
015148-0003	It is all very unique and you wont find any other baby wearing the same stuff.
015148-0004	I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess.
015148-0005	Afterall she will only be a baby for so long I figure why not enjoy it.
015573-0001	Buyer beware
015573-0002	Do not use these guys.
015573-0003	They'll tell you one thing then $5,000 later do another.
015573-0004	Lied right to my face then denied it.
015573-0005	Run away.
015687-0001	marisol
015687-0002	this place is awesome twelve did an amazing job place is clean and staff is friendly
016861-0001	Stayed in the Seaview room here in December 2009!
016861-0002	WOW what stunning views.
016861-0003	The furnishing and finishes are great.
016861-0004	I highly recommend Bay View if you are looking for Accommodation in Camps Bay.
017235-0001	Antique Lighting, Fixtures, Chicago
017235-0002	Great place for Antique Lighting!
017235-0003	I visited their huge Chicago lighting showroom and all I have to say is WOW!!
017235-0004	Lots of collections, many antique light fixtures, Chandeliers, custom lighting etc.
017235-0005	I think they have the largest collection for Chandeliers Chicago.
017235-0006	Antiques, Vintage, Contemporary & Modern Chandeliers.
017235-0007	I would recommend them for any custom lighting or Lighting Repair and Restoration Chicago
017345-0001	UGH!!!
017345-0002	Got some nice "freshly baked" fruit squares, a personal favorite of mine.
017345-0003	Took a bite, it tasted odd.
017345-0004	Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold!!!!
017345-0005	Ugh!!
017345-0006	I called the store and the clerk giggled, and agreed that it was gross, but said it was not her problem.
017345-0007	She also refused to get a manager.
017345-0008	I left my number, or tried to anyway.
017345-0009	Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number.
017345-0010	I'll never go back there again
018268-0001	best square slice around.
018465-0001	The Salon Experience from Hell
018465-0002	I feel obligated to share this story.
018465-0003	Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation.
018465-0004	Just graduated, just moved, not rich, and starting new job soon.
018465-0005	I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don't show up, they'll charge you.
018465-0006	I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick.
018465-0007	After he already put product on my hair he said "I should warn you, I'm expensive."
018465-0008	What was I supposed to do, say I can't afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair.
018465-0009	I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown.
018465-0010	The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he's so wonderful, you're going to love your hair.
018465-0011	$400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total.
018465-0012	Derrick did a terrible job, was a complete jerk the entire time, and I had no warning as to the price.
018465-0013	I cried the entire way home.
018465-0014	He then "fixed" it for free but it still looked like crap.
018465-0015	I will never go back.
018465-0016	It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell.
018465-0017	He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks.
018465-0018	That's my favorite show of all time.
018465-0019	I'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around.
018465-0020	Maybe he didn't do a good job and they told him so.
018465-0021	Absolute Nightmare!
018465-0022	STAY AWAY!
018548-0001	Mezza Luna FTW!
018548-0002	their mezza luna's are deffly better than the pizza rolls.
018548-0003	its like a pizza roll, but they just toss ham and cheese inside.
018548-0004	it seems like its healthier too, but its prolly not.
018548-0005	also, you can call em ahead of time, and then go to pick up ur food, or have it delivered**.
018548-0006	that cuts down on teh wait time, cus u can do other stuff while ur waiting.
018548-0007	it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna, as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix.
018548-0008	their pizza was a little salty for me, but its still good.
018548-0009	they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for +32 delicious.
018548-0010	anyways, the mezza luna: you should try it.
018548-0011	it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger.
018548-0012	**Edit: Living on campus at Clarkson University, I have had food delivered before.
018548-0013	This was back between '05 and '09 and I don't remember how many times we've had it delivered.
018548-0014	Perhaps they don't deliver anymore, but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup.
018562-0001	Great Job
018562-0002	I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need.
018562-0003	Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding.
018562-0004	It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us.
018562-0005	He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through.
018562-0006	I'm sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time.
018562-0007	My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep, and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer.
018562-0008	Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected.
018562-0009	Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally.

020851-0001	The Best Deals in Town
020851-0002	Before you buy ANYTHING in NY, make sure you stop by Jack-s first.
020851-0003	Their selection is random, so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store.
020851-0004	I love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances.
020851-0005	Trust me, you go there once and you-ll always go back!
020957-0001	He's great!
020957-0002	I won't go to anyone else.
020992-0001	Don't Expect Sleep or Courtesy
020992-0002	I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007.
020992-0003	At 3:15 am on night #2, the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room.
020992-0004	These are not household type alarms.
020992-0005	When they sound off, it is a true audio/visual experience.
020992-0006	I called the front desk and got no answer.
020992-0007	After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none, I decided to just pack up and leave.
020992-0008	The desk agent actually argued with me, claiming that no such alarm had gone off (as if I would make that up?).
020992-0009	He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded, so only 4 guests were effected (no big deal to him).
020992-0010	This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever, and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times.
020992-0011	This hotel is adequate enough, but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management.
020992-0012	Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night.
021370-0001	It's fine for...
021370-0002	It's fine for mass-market chocolate, but with companies like Scharffen Berger, TCHO, and smaller artisan chocolate makers in the area, why?
022273-0001	Good food, good location, and good prices.
022273-0002	But the servers don't pay attention to you whether it's busy or not.
022461-0001	The best in the area!
022461-0002	I've been to quite a few tattoo shops around this area and Stainless Steel is by far the best.
022461-0003	I am very pleased with the tattoos that I revived from them.
022461-0004	The artwork is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.
022461-0005	I would recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a tattoo.
022533-0001	Rude service
022533-0002	even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude.
022533-0003	I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me, or even just give me an approximate price range.
022533-0004	He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price.
022533-0005	What kind of rude service is that?
022533-0006	I don't want to waste my time with them.
022900-0001	Very hard work from the boys in blue there!
022900-0002	Brilll.
022900-0003	Very hard work from the boys in blue there!
023620-0001	This is one of the worst places I have stayed, we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry.
023620-0002	Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won't use, it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole.
023620-0003	The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager.
023620-0004	Bad service starting from the front desk.
023620-0005	The best person is the valet.
023620-0006	Short of that, avoid this place, as a silver Marriott member, this is a disgrace.
023926-0001	Great job!
023926-0002	Mercedes and Dan are very thorough and on top of everything!
024132-0001	Range Rover Sport Window Tints
024132-0002	Mark at Tintman Nationwidetints Ltd, did a very Professional job very quick, no fuss, deliverd the car to me and I drove him back home,Great arrangement Great price!!
024132-0003	Highly recommended!!
024132-0004	Thanks Mark.
024132-0005	Steve.... proud Range Rover Sport owner (with rear tints)
024306-0001	Worst Tasting Pizza
024306-0002	This place had the worst tasting pizza I have ever tasted it was possible the worst food I've ever eaten.
024306-0003	I don't recommend this place to anyone or even anything to eat.
024385-0001	Another great business bites the dust!
024385-0002	The best cakes EVER!
024385-0003	A bit pricey, so I didn't go very often, but it was always a treat when I did.
024385-0004	The prices were worth what I got.
024385-0005	I'm assuming they are completely out of business since I can't find any contact information.
024385-0006	I'm hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place, because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer.
025516-0001	Very friendly people offering a brilliant service.
025516-0002	Sent scented flowers home instead of postcards.
025516-0003	Recommend you call in for a look.
025894-0001	Average food and deathly slow service
025894-0002	I have eaten here several times and everytime the service is slower than slow.
025894-0003	One time we even left after sitting at the table for 20 minutes and not being greeted with a drink order.
025894-0004	Ridiculous.
025894-0005	There must be a better mexican place in Rockland.
026641-0001	You've Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home.
026641-0002	I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks!
026641-0003	Satisfactory for sure with the sercvice!
026641-0004	Beats having one "cleaning lady" who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the "maids" did!
026883-0001	Poor Service
026883-0002	Run don't walk.
026883-0003	My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger.
026883-0004	If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would.
026883-0005	On August 21st, 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it.
026883-0006	After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces.
026883-0007	I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered.
026883-0008	No one will give me a date.
026883-0009	I spent $2300 on the bedroom suite, which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor.
026883-0010	Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged: a piece of wood was broke on the headboard; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall; and a nighstand was missing a drawer.
026883-0011	How do you lose a drawer.
026883-0012	After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings, Boyles, the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned.
026883-0013	The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture.
026883-0014	So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite.
026883-0015	I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone's warehouse.
026883-0016	Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service.
028996-0001	Farrell Electric is a very good electrical contractor.
028996-0002	I'm pleased that someone referred me to them for my commercial business.
028996-0003	I own a property management firm and need a contractor with the credentials that Farrell Electric has.
029218-0001	Our Wedding 11/7/08
029218-0002	We just had our wedding on 11/7/08 and was very impressed.
029218-0003	Cj and company did all that we ask and 10 times more.
029218-0004	The food was out standing.
029218-0005	If you need a cater that is affordable and easy to work with they are the ones.
029218-0006	Thanks again Saucey's.
029218-0007	Mark
029230-0001	Best Store In Boothbay Harbor
029230-0002	What a fantastic store, I love this place.
029230-0003	Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have.
029230-0004	Their items are very unique, great quality, great prices.
029230-0005	They also have the best tea I ever had, not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores, I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter.
029870-0001	I found Bright Star Tours and Travels and Best and Affordable Tour Operators and Tours Agents in Chennai, India offered me Student Tour India Package for very less price.
029870-0002	I enjoyed my tour and i am looking for adventure tour and India heritage tours for valuable.
029870-0003	Thanks for Bright Star Tours.
030126-0001	HORRIBLE
030126-0002	This school is the worst one i've ever been to.
030126-0003	I attended it for 2 years, and that was enough.
030126-0004	There's holes everywhere in the ceiling, sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling, and the whole condition of the school is horrible.
030126-0005	The staff and the Principal are rediculous, they don't listen to any input, and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks, because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student's).
030126-0006	The education is horrible at best, do society a favor, and do NOT send your student here.
030395-0001	Sanctuary is amazing!
030395-0002	Sanctuary serves delicious, somewhat healthy food in a great restaurant/fast food style.
030395-0003	The employees are really friendly.
030395-0004	And they deliver!
030430-0001	Amazing customer service
030430-0002	I think the women at this salon know that their business is based primarily from referrals. :)
030430-0003	They were amazingly hospitable.
030430-0004	Edit was the best massage therapist I've ever had and I would HIGHLY recommend her!
030811-0001	I've only had good experiences at Adorn, I was greeted and offered a refreshment.
030811-0002	I highly recommend Debi, she does an amazing job, I "love" the way she cuts my hair, extremely thorough and cross checks her work to make sure my hair is perfect.
030811-0003	I always leave loving my hair style.
030875-0001	Slice Pizza at former Britt's Location
030875-0002	Britt's Pizza is long gone.
030875-0003	Their location, the northwest corner of S. 10th & Federal Sts., is now home to Slice Pizza.
031113-0001	Good Pizza at a good price
031113-0002	I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places, this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it.
031113-0003	The pizza is usually pretty good, the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more, but it was still good.
031113-0004	Their BBQ chicken pizza is one of the better ones I have ever had.
031674-0001	Responsive, kept me apprised of status.
034313-0001	criminal defense lawyer
034313-0002	Mr. Villega is an exceptional California criminal defense lawyer.
034313-0003	He cross examined witnesses relentlessly and had them break down and tell the truth.
034313-0004	If you want an attorney who will defend your right, contact Law Offices of Armando Villega
034320-0001	Fresh and unic!
034320-0002	Very professional, talented, unic and fresh work.
034320-0003	Paula has an amazing gift for creativity, vision and the ability to combine art to / with commercial purpose.
034320-0004	Bravo!
034501-0001	Best Stationery store in Bethesda
034501-0002	Papeluna, a cute Mom/Pop custom printing and paper store, just opened a few days ago.
034501-0003	It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell's.
034501-0004	I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks.
034501-0005	It's an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness.
034501-0006	Cards, wrapping paper, paper, and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be.
034501-0007	I gave the woman I spoke with today a "You've been yelped!" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna.
034501-0008	I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more.
034501-0009	printing, printing, copies, printing, copies, printing,
034813-0001	Baffled by the one-star reviews
034813-0002	I don't get it.
034813-0003	This place is awesome, with a great ambiance and cool décor, and the food is scrumptious (and especially their signature banana split).
034813-0004	Sure, some items are a little pricey, but c'mon... have you ever been out to eat in Seattle before?
034858-0001	Thank you for fixing the leak on my bathroom!
034858-0002	Thanks!
034995-0001	Food is often expired so check the dates every time!
034995-0002	Also more often than not you end up with a healthy dose of nasty rude attitude from the employees!
035726-0001	The BEST
035726-0002	Dr. Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters.
035726-0003	Dr. Aster is very kind an gentle with the children, but also positive and to the point with the parents.
035726-0004	She is and excellent doctor to have on one's team.
035726-0005	Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST!
035899-0001	Highly Recommended
035899-0002	We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff.
035899-0003	The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal.
035899-0004	Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in.
035899-0005	We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it's worth the extra travel, as the care provided exceeds our expectations... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere.
035932-0001	Simple, Quick take away.
035993-0001	They have fresh flowers, lasted a long while in the vase, and the two ladies at the shop know the business well.
035993-0002	I had no problem with my delivery.
035993-0003	I will go there again.
036133-0001	Bit sketchy, sporadic delivery times
036133-0002	I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place.
036133-0003	Why?
036133-0004	Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash.
036133-0005	Sketchy, right?
036133-0006	Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days.
036133-0007	(They even got me a couch pretty quickly.)
036133-0008	The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly, Ahmed, was nice and mostly professional, except the semi-sketchiness.
036133-0009	Then one day, Ahmed left the country, not to return for months, WITHOUT informing me.
036133-0010	He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in.
036133-0011	The other person working at the store didn't know that I still had this table coming.
036133-0012	I had paid in cash, and he said he had no receipt/record of my purchase.
036133-0013	I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase, and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation.
036133-0014	I waited.
036133-0015	And waited.
036133-0016	He never once contacted us.
036133-0017	I've had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive.
036133-0018	He kept saying different arrival/delivery dates and didn't seem terribly apologetic.
036133-0019	It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don't have my table (which was NOT cheap, I might add).
036133-0020	Point is: You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong, you'll have to fight to get it resolved.
036753-0001	sheisters
036753-0002	i made the mistake of buying from these thieves.
036753-0003	I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor.
036753-0004	Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck".
036753-0005	Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right?
036753-0006	Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home.
036753-0007	The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing,engine is junk.
036753-0008	I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back.
036753-0009	From a moral standpoint,you guys are really gonna take 2,000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal?
036753-0010	If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day?
036753-0011	Grimy work you guys do.
036753-0012	Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2k bucks.
037179-0001	spot on
037179-0002	this kebab shop is one of the best around the meat is good and fresh and the chilly sauce is the best, keep them lovely kebabs coming and a happy new year to all the staff
037794-0001	We came at around 730 and they close at 8 and wanted to try the specials but they were out for the day so I would say go way before they close.
037794-0002	Got the crab rangoon which was great, tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good.
037794-0003	Def going to come back and try this place again.
037794-0004	Bea was really nice and asked how the food was.
037794-0005	Cute place also
038358-0001	heating system Angels
038358-0002	seriously, can you imagine having to live through these last few nights without heat?
038358-0003	I would have had to because with the economy the way it is i aint haves much monies fo repairs round the House....
038358-0004	Comfort zone came out and did my house heat on the cheap.
038358-0005	and it works!
038358-0006	Thank you Comfort Zone
038523-0001	Friendly service.
038523-0002	Attentive to the needs of customer.
038523-0003	Thanks again!
039173-0001	The waiting staff is really friendly, its like every one knows each other, the manager is really sweet and the food..well no complaints from me.
039173-0002	Yes, its that good.
039383-0001	Might try again
039383-0002	Pros: * Jill, the owner, is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection, I like!
039383-0003	Don't know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides.
039383-0004	Cons: * Server wasn't very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time, took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating.
039383-0005	Half the tables and bar were empty by this point.
039383-0006	Other Thoughts: Will try this place again.
039383-0007	There must be a reason so many people like it there.
039383-0008	Their Club sandwich looks tasty, maybe that'll change my mind.... and a different server.
039856-0001	HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!
039856-0002	Absolute horrible service from the parts department.
039856-0003	They are very rude over the phone and in person.
039856-0004	They talk down to you like they are supreme beings, if you hate your job so much then quit!!
039856-0005	How these guys can get away with being so rude with people is mind blowing.
039856-0006	I will NEVER do business with Sun Toyota again.
039856-0007	Thank god there are plenty of Toyota dealerships to choose from in this city.
040616-0001	we purchased a new home but was unable to sell our old house so we contacted this property management company and they have helped us quickly rent out our house and keep it maintained.
040616-0002	Since then we have decided to have them manage our other investment properties as well as we getting older and can no longer perform all the inquires.
040616-0003	Great help!
041925-0001	I heard the libido band play live and they are out of site!!
041925-0002	I will be calling tropics for my companies next event!
042012-0001	When in Scordia, Sicily
042012-0002	If ever in Sicily please take the time to visit Anna Maria Jose Mudo and her familia.
042012-0003	They are and always will be the nicest people in Sicily that you will meet.
042012-0004	You will also have the pleasure of learning the Italiano language.
042012-0005	You will also have the experience of learning the bella Sicilian culture, that I have fallen in luv with.
042012-0006	I will 4-ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my Sicilian family showed me when I was there for 3 years.
042012-0007	Luv always..
042085-0001	Rubbish
042085-0002	Took 1+ hour to deliver to Chatham, hair in food, driver didn't know area.
042085-0003	Noticed a few of these Cookie cutter places opening in Summit and New Providence.
042085-0004	Stick to Hop Hing, 20 year+ resident.
042416-0001	Can't wait to go back!!!
042416-0002	This is by far the BEST B&B that we have ever stayed at!
042416-0003	We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at.
042416-0004	We could not have been more welcomed, more comfortable or more well fed.
042416-0005	The weekend was perfect in every way, in large part to Sue and her great staff.
042416-0006	Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well.
042416-0007	We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B&B...especially my 4 year old, who made friends with Ms. Sue and all the ladies, and has talked about them since we left!
042416-0008	We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe!
042530-0001	a staple!
042530-0002	I live in the neighborhood and this place is one of my favorites for a tasty, quick and inexpensive meal.
042530-0003	Branch out and try something other than the Pad Thai, the curries are fantastic.
042530-0004	Fast and friendly service, they know my order when I walk in the door!
043020-0001	Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem!
043020-0002	B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June.
043020-0003	They were very polite, eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence.
043020-0004	Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "Workmanship is guaranteed for a year!".
043020-0005	Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in.
043020-0006	We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of.
043020-0007	We heard nothing.
043020-0008	We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he'd send someone out to look at it but couldn't promise when- two weeks came and went and we heard nothing.
043020-0009	I just called again and was told that workmanship, not wood, is guaranteed for a year- well in my opinion- the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship!
043020-0010	She even went so far as to say "Your calling about one board?"
043020-0011	Well- when you pay over $1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good!!!
043020-0012	YES!
043020-0013	I WAS calling about one board!!
043020-0014	I'm very frustrated at this point- it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked (the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer.
043020-0015	So I figure if they don't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money!!!
043020-0016	STAY AWAY!!!
043020-0017	YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!
043020-0018	They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why!!!
043020-0019	When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars, now for their poor customer follow-up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one-star in my opinion!
044427-0001	Good and Bad
044427-0002	I had to take care of the ants myself.
044427-0003	But I found the location wonderful and the neighbors very kind.
044427-0004	Never had a problem with the staff and found them very helpful when something went wrong.
044427-0005	Loved the pool and BBQ.
044427-0006	Because of the ants I dropped them to a 3 star.
045753-0001	Compare to last decade this University is gaining more prestige in International level
045972-0001	Feel good
045972-0002	I just wanted to try your clinic because I was not totally happy with my current therapist I regularly see.
045972-0003	Now I've found someone who can manage to do what I really want.
046500-0001	Mens and Boys Barbers, on the number 9 Bus route.
046500-0002	Ladies room, Open Sundays
046906-0001	rug works for me
047007-0001	Called to check if they had a product I've been using on my dog for years... the boy who answered the phone couldn't possibly have been ruder to me.
047007-0002	I will never come here again.
047184-0001	New training Centre is excellent
047184-0002	The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull.
047184-0003	The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull.
047184-0004	The classes cover all age and skill ranges, with BALLROOM, LATIN, SEQUENCE, STREET, DISCO, LINE DANCING, BALLET, TAP & JAZZ.
047184-0005	We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening....
047184-0006	It is not really possible to score this school too highly, We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
047762-0001	My Favorite place at Wildwood
047762-0002	I have been going to the Wildwood, NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first.
047762-0003	I rated it 5 stars.
047762-0004	I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel.
047762-0005	I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood, this hotel has everything that we are looking for.
047762-0006	It is the hospitality from Tom and staff, that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach.
047762-0007	We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean.
047891-0001	Great job on my roof and the pricing was fair.
047891-0002	Will use again in the future.
048198-0001	Lovely Cottage
048198-0002	This cottage is a charming homely, friendly, place to stay.
048198-0003	Mary is an excellent host who does yummy breakfasts.
048198-0004	My room was delightful and the attention to detail was amazing.
048198-0005	Will come again!
048198-0006	Sophie.
048201-0001	Very Mediocre donuts!
048201-0002	The Donuts were very over proofed, making them stale and bready.
048201-0003	The service was friendly and fast, but this just doesnt make up for the lack-luster product.
048201-0004	We tried 4 different style of donuts, they were all the same when it came to quality.
048302-0001	Blooming onion, the only reason to visit this restaurant.
048363-0001	Excellent Driving School
048363-0002	I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I've been a nervous wreck and haven't been behind the wheel.
048363-0003	Unfortunately, a family emergency required me to conquer this fear.
048363-0004	A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry.
048363-0005	She highly recommended him and described him as the "Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is ....very calm, pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions".
048363-0006	I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package.
048363-0007	I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson.
048363-0008	Five minutes before my initial lesson, I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready.
048363-0009	My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus!
048363-0010	I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn't feel comfortable driving an SUV.
048363-0011	Gerry pleasantly said " since I am already here why don't we give it shot.
048363-0012	I trust you and believe that you'll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate!
048363-0013	Trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself.
048363-0014	Don't worry, I'll take care of you!"
048363-0015	....... the rest was history!
048363-0016	Here I am now driving confidently on my own.
048363-0017	Gerry, I can't thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear.
048363-0018	To my friend, thank you for your recommendation... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a "Saintly Instructor ...Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is!
048644-0001	Don't judge a book by its cover
048644-0002	From the outside Ichiban looks like it will be terrible.
048644-0003	This couldn't be farther from the truth.
048644-0004	The food is amazing, and the prices cannot be beat.
048644-0005	The sushi is great, and they have a great selection.
049766-0001	WWW-Wonderful Wild Wildernest inn
049766-0002	I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five!
049766-0003	Atop Spring Mountain, from the decks of the West porch, "one can see forever" a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur.
049766-0004	I saw deer frequently, in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge.
049766-0005	There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning.
049766-0006	and most correctly, us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife.
049766-0007	It would have been more than one could bear!
049766-0008	Kathy and Stewart, the proprietors were the epitome of perfection.
049766-0009	Delightful, hospitable, superb,cozy and comfortable.
049766-0010	I hope to be back!
052836-0001	Bad food and bad service!
052836-0002	Save yourself a trip!
052884-0001	unique gifts and cards
053248-0001	Quit with the overstatements!
053248-0002	The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "everyone" is going to "love" the food, decor and service.
053248-0003	The truth is, in my and my dining partners' experience, this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food.
053248-0004	It's an entirely up and down experience, however.
053248-0005	Now, the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal.
053248-0006	The salatim salads are the smallest plates I've ever seen placed in front of me (you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't explained to you).
053248-0007	Though they are mostly excellent, you generally don't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them.
053248-0008	That being said, the laffa and hummus are out of this world.
053248-0009	Then again, for the three of us who dined together, two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more, and licking the hummus from our fingers (and yes, those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three-person order).
053248-0010	Dinner was also an up-and-down experience.
053248-0011	The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot-on, while the lamb was often dry and/or overcooked.
053248-0012	The duck was a 65% glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy, crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments.
053248-0013	Dessert was... hmmm, that's interesting, I don't even remember dessert.
053248-0014	I guess that tells you a lot.
053248-0015	Oh, yes, the chocolate semifreddo was quite good.
053248-0016	The warm chocolate cake was very tasty, but served at room temperature, not warm by any stretch of the imagination.
053248-0017	And my--no, I still don't remember what I had.
053248-0018	Service was average, but nothing special, and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly, not merely capable.
053248-0019	Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests (and as the many golden reviews seem to attest), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience.
053248-0020	But one should not go here expecting something fantastic, unless perhaps you've never had middle-eastern food before, or succulent duck, tasty lamb, decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts.
053248-0021	PS) When we called for a reservation, we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings.
053248-0022	When we arrived at 5, and left circa 7, there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us.
053248-0023	Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all, and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience?
054269-0001	Excellent energy efficiency
054269-0002	Compact's Corona dryers remove at least twice as much water as the previous dryers, allowing a production increase of over 10% and a significant energy saving.
054496-0001	I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted (a reball) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price.
054496-0002	Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty.
054496-0003	It was a no brainer really.
054496-0004	I choose Console Pros and I'm happy I did.
054798-0001	Where else can you go for $10 and recieve this treatment?!
054798-0002	Awesome haircut at awesome price right here in Palatine!
054798-0003	Who can pass up a hot towel and a straight edge neck shave!
054798-0004	I've had 2 cuts now from Georgia and have paid more in other salons/barbershops and have not received this kind of treatment or cut!
055207-0001	Spay and neuter service.
055207-0002	I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful.
055207-0003	But I had my cat spayed through their reduced/free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away, and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections.
055207-0004	My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery, So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit.
055207-0005	You'd think they would do a good job but they don't care unless they are getting paid full price.
055207-0006	Which is so dumb.
055207-0007	Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery.
055976-0001	The staff leaves a lot to be desired.
055976-0002	The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude.
055976-0003	A simple follow-up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare.
055976-0004	She may be the reason for all the change.
055976-0005	I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice.
055976-0006	If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him.
055976-0007	Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor.
055976-0008	He was an okay doctor but not worth her.
056408-0001	Dessert was good.
056408-0002	Rest was too oily.
057386-0001	friendly, fine food
057386-0002	The one-star review from 2005 is out of date.
057386-0003	There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly.
057386-0004	The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches, homemade soups, fresh salads.
057386-0005	The atmosphere may not be for everyone.
057386-0006	It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table (as in many European cafes), but if you are OK with that, the food is very good.
057386-0007	Love the soups.
057644-0001	find another place
057644-0002	Run down.
057644-0003	Dark, dark main room.
057644-0004	No way to read/relax.
057644-0005	'Electric' blanket on one bed did not heat.
057644-0006	Quite cold.
057644-0007	Removing 90% of 'sit-abouts' in main room would look cleaner.
058009-0001	It taste better than In and Out....
058274-0001	Food - very good for a midnight meal that isn't fast food.
058274-0002	Service - the workers are usually pleasant.
058274-0003	Atmosphere is always fun, the assortment of customers adds entertainment to the meal
058878-0001	Nice little locally owned greek bar and grill.
058878-0002	Good food.
058878-0003	Great wings!
059005-0001	I <3 Max's
059005-0002	Excellent bagels and excellent service!
059005-0003	I go in about every morning to get bagels for myself or my co-workers and the employees at Max's are great!!
059005-0004	They are friendly and fast.
059005-0005	I have never had a problem with their hours because I always go during the mornings.
059005-0006	They are great!
059088-0001	Best Cigar lounge on the blouvard.
059088-0002	Encino has been blessed by the opening of this smoke shop most definately.
059088-0003	If you mention the name Amir you will receive %10 off at time of purchase
059386-0001	Best YET!
059386-0002	We go to Japaneiro's all the time and we have NEVER been disappointed!
059386-0003	Wait staff is always ready to help if you can't decide (which happens every time for me d/t the huge menu of rolls) and always courteous!
059386-0004	Soooo tasty!
059416-0001	Excellent food, fantastic wait staff
059416-0002	I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser's.
059416-0003	We had 30 guests for the event, and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food, but the outstanding service as well.
059416-0004	The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages, and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless.
059416-0005	I highly recommend Fraiser's for anyone planning a special event for friends, family or business.
059655-0001	the team at barton car wash was very friendly .
059655-0002	and did great job .
059655-0003	i was very pleased with the service.
059685-0001	Fast and great service on pool covers
060396-0001	The best Thai food I've ever had in Australia, very fresh and so much favor of authentic Thai .
060396-0002	The restaurant is the most beautiful thai restaurant in Geelong... just love it
061079-0001	Friendliest place I have ever stayed!
061721-0001	What a Dump!
061721-0002	The food is terrible.
061721-0003	The place smells and the owner is very very rude!
061721-0004	I could go on and on!
061721-0005	Just don't go there.
061768-0001	Horrible customer service.
061768-0002	I came in to get a nice gift for my wife.
061768-0003	The one guy who was there, I'm guessing was the owner, was probably the least helpful person I've ever met.
061768-0004	But thankfully there are other flowers shops around Norman.
062167-0001	Highly Recommend
062167-0002	I work as a Transformational Life Coach.
062167-0003	Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate.
062167-0004	I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide.
062167-0005	Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well!
062167-0006	She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member's suicide, coupled with elder abuse.
062167-0007	I found her to be extremely solid, kind, compassionate, and intuitive as well.
062167-0008	I would recommend her highly!
063347-0001	a great vacation!
063347-0002	We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more!
063347-0003	Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts.
063347-0004	After a train ride over the mountains, we enjoyed hiking in the flower-filled Wenatchee hills (in May) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River...and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening....
063347-0005	This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant, which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need, and I'm sure they will do their best to be hospitable.
063549-0001	Best food in northeast
063549-0002	Theres a reason why Frank mcclelland was named best chef of the north east reigon.
063549-0003	Food here is absolutely superb.
063549-0004	Everything is delicous and cooked perfectly.
063549-0005	The waiting staff is beyond impeccable (they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom).
063549-0006	If you want great food then L'espalier is the place to go.
063690-0001	This office is awesome!
063690-0002	everyone here is super friendly and efficient!
063690-0003	its great to know you can get great service, great product, and for the best price all in one!
063690-0004	I've referred everyone i know here and they all feel the same way!!
063690-0005	i'll be coming back for years to come!
063754-0001	Chuck and Gretchen were very positive, and when Alan's refused to work on my bike, Chuck came right out and saw the problem and did what Alan's mechanic wouldn't do.
063754-0002	He worked on it right on the back of my car.
063754-0003	I am extremely pleased
063963-0001	Don't waste your time or money!
063963-0002	I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest, apart from the shark walkway, I thought it was rubbish and overpriced.
063963-0003	Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round, it took us just over one hour start to finish.
063963-0004	If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this.
063963-0005	If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £30 for 2 two people then go for it.
063963-0006	(For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me!)
064100-0001	Great spot to kick back for a cup of joe and a snack.
064100-0002	Cool ambience.
064146-0001	Best Pizzas and Calzones in the City!
064146-0002	What a hidden gem!
064146-0003	The food is superb and they were delivered nice and hot!
064146-0004	I highly recommend this place!
067423-0001	Doctor Hank is Amazing
067423-0002	Our family has been trusting Doctor Hank with our teeth for the last seven years.
067423-0003	I wouldn't go to anyone else.
067423-0004	Everyone on staff is very professional and friendly.
067826-0001	If you're looking for homestyle Japanese food, you can't beat this
068009-0001	Criminal Attorney Dallas
068009-0002	Dallas Criminal Attorney Peter Barrett is absolutely committed to vigorously supporting your rights and achieving a successful outcome.
068009-0003	As a qualified criminal defense attorney, he will work every possible legal "angle" (leaving no stone unturned) of your case to achieve the most favorable result possible.
068436-0001	The worst Burger King restaurant!!!
068436-0002	I generally like the BK over the other fast serving restaurants; however, I regreted to visit this restaurant at my town.
068436-0003	This is a shame of my adorable town, Branford.
068436-0004	I ordered a kid meal with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already.
068436-0005	I asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay.
068436-0006	Disgusting french fries is very best menu.
068436-0007	Don't go, or you will learn how to waste your money.
069995-0001	AMAZING NIGHT- Great Party Spot!!
069995-0002	Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks...place is awesome.
069995-0003	Had to keep in mind that the A/C broke, I feel bad it was their opening!
069995-0004	Anyway, once that is fixed, this place will be amazing.
069995-0005	Drinks were awesome, prices reasonable, and staff friendly.
069995-0006	This is an awesome date spot that the area SERIOUSLY needs.
069995-0007	Check out The Willow Lounge, youll be happy!
070492-0001	Good, friendly, reasonable service
070730-0001	We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls-- live scallop sashimi, duck breast nigiri with foie gras, panko mussels-- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price.
070730-0002	Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll, spicy crab and tuna roll, and sweet potato tempura roll ($15, $10, and $3.75 respectively).
070730-0003	The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise: cheap and delicious, the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value (and I never get vegetarian rolls).
070730-0004	The other rolls weren't at all special, especially given their pricing.
070730-0005	The bottom line is that the food isn't great and is relatively high-priced.
070730-0006	The service is solicitous, the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out-of-place flat-screen TV playing football.
070730-0007	But I'd go elsewhere unless the prices are cut.
070730-0008	It's just not worth it.
071017-0001	It was ok, nice management, they let us check in early, but the place was old.
071017-0002	It was clean, but just a little dumpy.
071017-0003	Lots of room for big rig parking.
071017-0004	Hard to get into though because of road construction.
071278-0001	WOW!!!
071278-0002	I can't say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee.
071278-0003	Gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me!!!!
071278-0004	She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls!
071278-0005	She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her!!!
071278-0006	She is caring, punctual, and very enthusiastic about her job!
071278-0007	You should give her a try - it's worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting!!!!
071518-0001	Great, Honest Service
071518-0002	I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold.
071518-0003	The dealer wanted $1300 to fix that and another $1500 to fix some other things.
071518-0004	Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $400!!
071518-0005	I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission!
071518-0006	I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon.
071518-0007	I have finally found a mechanic I trust!!
071518-0008	And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus!!
071650-0001	I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner's own unprofessionalism.
071650-0002	When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away.
071650-0003	I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional.
071650-0004	Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun.
071650-0005	The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there.
071650-0006	They need to update the locker rooms ASAP.
071650-0007	Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away.
071650-0008	The owner was VERY rude, accused me of not reading my contract, and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership.
071650-0009	I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $50 fee (which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner.
071650-0010	I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club's actual OWNER?!
071650-0011	Bad for business.
071650-0012	I was appalled.
071650-0013	I will never recommend this gym to any woman.
071650-0014	The equipment and classes aren't good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff!!!
071650-0015	There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500!
072067-0001	Great School!
072067-0002	Teachers good Diverse student body(African-American, Asian, ect.) equals kids staying here!
072271-0001	Pure Beauty
072271-0002	What a joy to stroll off historic Canyon Road in Santa Fe into a gallery with a gorgeous diversity of art.
072271-0003	Destiny Allison's metal sculptures were my favorite.
072271-0004	The owner Karla is welcoming and fun.
072271-0005	Give yourself the gift of visiting Winterowd Fine Art!
072507-0001	Dave is a patient and methodical teacher, who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take.
072507-0002	Also, he loves teaching so much, his price is unbeatable, but that does not change his level of skill.
072507-0003	Dave has much to offer.
072507-0004	In just 2-3 focused lessons, I'm already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence!

073356-0001	Beautiful hotel!
073356-0002	Great service- high class!
073356-0003	Shuttle available to a private beach area with food/drinks/towels.
073742-0001	Food is always good
074896-0001	Excellent service
074896-0002	I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price, but I go to the Garment District for their service.
074896-0003	Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that, but I find the staff more helpful than anything else.
074896-0004	Tiffany is fabulous!
074896-0005	I came in for alterations (free, by the way) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse.
074896-0006	She immediately went to the back, brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot.
074896-0007	I didn't even buy the bag there!
074896-0008	Huge selection and, great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don't have what you need.
076352-0001	Very Accomodating
076352-0002	We were in Springfield, IL for a family funeral from Kansas City.
076352-0003	We arrived early and the staff was very accomodating to our families and the situation we were in.
076352-0004	The rooms were very clean, including the microwave and refrigerator.
076352-0005	This is a nice place, and I know we will return to meet my sister-in-law from Chicago!!
076440-0001	really amazing the new and exciting plays done at this theatre !
077034-0001	I loved the atmosphere here and the food is good, however the tables are so close together that it feels very cramped.
077034-0002	We were made to feel very welcome.
077034-0003	Well worth a visit.
077034-0004	http://cambridgefoodfrivolity.blogspot.com/
077213-0001	the food is mediocre at best.
077213-0002	the waitress took my name and then called me that all night.
077213-0003	not sure how I feel about that one.
077213-0004	it's passable as a pub, but the pizza is not that great.
077213-0005	if you want good pizza, go to famoso.
077213-0006	seriously.
077298-0001	Had a horrible experience with a manager here, Rachel McInnis, she was rude, inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly...
077298-0002	I'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake.
077298-0003	I normally don't write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished, upscale place to shop, this one won't be getting my business, nor my family's, nor my co-workers.
077298-0004	It's never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy, especially when they are right.
077344-0001	No service.. But good food..
077414-0001	Small Firm with Great Service
077414-0002	Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem, and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with.
077414-0003	I much preferred the one-on-one service here to the experiences I've had with bigger offices and firms.
077414-0004	While I hope I don't have any need for a lawyer anytime soon, if I do I'll definitely use this firm again.
079007-0001	Their food and sweets are awesome.
079007-0002	But service is very poor.
079007-0003	Attitude of staff very bad.
079007-0004	Never gives a receipt.
079007-0005	Sometimes even gives wrong dish.
079007-0006	So confused at the payment area.
079007-0007	Line up is so stupid.
079007-0008	Even if you line up.
079007-0009	To make a order you may have to go to back of line.
079007-0010	And then wait again.
079007-0011	Not organised.
079375-0001	Thank you!
079375-0002	I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated.
079375-0003	They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved.
079375-0004	We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them.
079375-0005	lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash.
079375-0006	In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash.
079375-0007	I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil!
079375-0008	I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals.
079375-0009	I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them!
079375-0010	Infact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated.
079827-0001	Fantastic fresh food!
079827-0002	What a neat gem of a restaurant in a corner one wouldn't expect it.
079827-0003	Cozy, warm atmosphere, great service.
079827-0004	Most importantly, the food was outstanding.
079827-0005	It clearly had been prepared from fresh ingredients.
079827-0006	We'll be back often.
080178-0001	You will be happy at this store!
080178-0002	Allen Tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in Temecula.
080178-0003	The store manager, Jim Smith, made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus.
080178-0004	Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns.
080178-0005	The store is clean, run very professionally and a pleasure to be in.
080178-0006	They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right.

080814-0002	These guys really know their stuff .. they have almost anything you could want in terms of spy and surviellance equipment.
080814-0003	Truly james bond style stuff ... would recommend
080854-0001	Fast and affordable.
080854-0002	Great job master keying our building.
081116-0001	Best fried shrimp in the state!
081796-0001	Exile is the best!!!
081796-0002	Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond!
081796-0003	I have been shopping there for over six years now.
081796-0004	The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner, Mimmy, is an absolute angel.
081796-0005	The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe.
081796-0006	In addition, the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic, which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia.
081796-0007	Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community.
081796-0008	Shop local at Exile!!
081934-0001	Liquidweb.com Rocks!!!
081934-0002	I am not a client of liquidweb.com, but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites.
081934-0003	I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb.
081934-0004	As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not, and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting.
081934-0005	The kind of support they provide is simply great!!!
081934-0006	I would like to host my upcoming website to Liquidweb.com
083454-0001	I didn't end up buying my car here, but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me.
083454-0002	Also they will fill your tires with air and other small maintenance tasks for free, even if you didn't buy your car there!
083459-0001	They don't seem to be interested in selling cars.
083459-0002	Went there yesterday: we are trying to decide between two different Honda models, so we wanted to test-drive both back to back.
083459-0003	The salesperson refused!
083459-0004	Claimed he was too busy for two test drives.
083459-0005	We were the only customers there!
083459-0006	Don't waste time, just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek, they actually do try to help their customers there!
083563-0001	We would like to thank our emergency plumbers who visted our shop in Morningside Road today.
083563-0002	A fast service, saved a bad situation getting alot worse.
083563-0003	many thanks 2scompany...
083849-0001	Surprisingly, this little strip mall restaurant has the best sushi I've found in the Tampa area.
083849-0002	It's fresh and really tasty.
083849-0003	I'll drive an hour just for their volcano, yum!
084373-0001	We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window.
084373-0002	Our window panes were so dirty that they needed a specialist to come and clean them.
084373-0003	We called few companies before we decide to hire them.
084373-0004	They came on time and completed their work quickly.
084373-0005	We were very happy how clean looked our windows.
084373-0006	If you have some problems with your windows, you should call them.
085009-0001	Awesome Landscaping Job
085009-0002	MFJ Inc transformed our run down back yard into a place of beauty.
085009-0003	The work was completed within one week, and everything was cleaned up on completion.
085009-0004	Highly recommended landscaper!!!
085424-0001	Cathy ******Five Stars for Lake Forest Tots.
085424-0002	The program has been a postive experience for my children.
085424-0003	I have had all three of my children attend Lake Forest Tots.
085424-0004	The program is well established and we have been extremely satisfied with the teachers, the programs and the director.
085424-0005	Good job, Lake Forest Tots!
085980-0001	After recently relocating to South Bend, we were looking for a delicious, fun, yet elegant establishment for New Years Eve dinner.
085980-0002	We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal, and accessibility to the Jazz Club.
085980-0003	The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor, especially for being a special NYE menu.
085980-0004	The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced.
085980-0005	After our meal, our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $10/person to stay and listen to the band, despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list.
085980-0006	This was a less than impressive experience at Trio's.
086839-0001	Terrible Service
086839-0002	One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a auto repair shop.
086839-0003	We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning.
086839-0004	Approx 4 months later, the compressor went out.
086839-0005	We took it back in to have it repaired again, and less than a week later the second compressor went out.
086839-0006	We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again, but this time when we picked up the car, the radio and clock did not work.
086839-0007	So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks, we brought the car back again.
086839-0008	When we expressed our discontent to the manager (that's right, the manager), did he say he would return some money, did he say he would give a discount on our next visit, did he just say "I'm sorry".
086839-0009	Nope, none of the above.
086839-0010	He stood there and told us how he wasn't at fault.
086839-0011	It was the fault of the parts supplier, and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car.
086839-0012	And what did we expect...that he bench test every part.
086839-0013	At no time during the conversation did the words, "I'm sorry" ever come out of his mouth.
086839-0014	I, nor anyone else in my family, will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again.
086839-0015	Well, unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out.
086914-0001	Wonderful Wonderful People!
086914-0002	I refer to VNHH often and love you guys.
087176-0001	A++
087176-0002	They are by far the best salon in 50 miles, Trust me I know!!
087368-0001	Walgreens on University
087368-0002	My pharmacy order is always correct and promptly delivered but the pharmacy staff are always very short with me and don't seem to like answering questions.
087368-0003	Clean store, friendly check-out staff up front.
087368-0004	Good selection.
088914-0001	They did a vehicle wrap for my Toyota Venza that looks amazing.
088914-0002	They also do banners, billboards and lots more.
088954-0001	A thoroughly comprehensive service; excellent communication and best of they are transparent with their fee (ie nothing is simply implied or assumed).
089136-0001	AWESOME food!
089136-0002	Make sure to put OILY sauces on your food to make it moist!
089136-0003	YUM
090136-0001	simple but perfect
090136-0002	IF you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes, this is not the place for you.
090136-0003	If you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients, you'll love Vetri.
090136-0004	Hands-down the best pasta and gnocchi I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot).
090136-0005	The antipasti were amazing, the wines were mind-blowing, the service couldn't have been better.
090136-0006	I've dined at lots of high-end restaurants and I've never before felt my money was so well spent.
090390-0001	wrong location
090390-0002	this is not where the Blue Water Bridge Duty Free is located.
090390-0003	It is, surprisingly, near the Blue Water Bridges, some miles to the west of this location.
090643-0001	Outstanding service & quality at a very affordable price!
090643-0002	This place is top notch and highly affordable!
090643-0003	I would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer.
090643-0004	I've also sent over a number of friends to use the services here and everyone is extraordinarily pleased!
090643-0005	Thanks for doing such great work on my important pieces of clothing that always look great!
091704-0001	Oil Change Disaster
091704-0002	My wife had taken her '07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change.
091704-0003	A couple days after the oil change, the engine ran rough, the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically, and the engine would whir loudly.
091704-0004	Turns out the engine had no oil, and when oil was put it, it would just run out of the filter.
091704-0005	There could have (hopefully doesn't have) major damage to the engine.
091704-0006	All of this started after their oil change.
091704-0007	Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife's work and towed it back to fix it.
091704-0008	I would not recommend this shop for anything, not even something as simple as an oil change.
091704-0009	Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything, and smile while doing it.
093655-0001	HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
093655-0002	not only is this place too expensive for what it is, its horrible!
093655-0003	In the past, I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak (and this was the sirloin!), the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side.
093655-0004	Today we went for a party (during lunch, so the place was empty) with about 25 other people.
093655-0005	It took over 1.5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it!
093655-0006	Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad?
093655-0007	I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others, as I was the last to get my food.
093655-0008	I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here.
093655-0009	Texas Roadhouse is WAY better!!
094189-0001	Needs to go out of business
094189-0002	They close whenever they feel like it, often well before their listed closing time.
094189-0003	Their store is dusty, dirty and feels like you're stepping into the 1970s.
094189-0004	They don't take coupons.
094189-0005	They have a credit card minimum.
094189-0006	This place is the opposite of QuikTrip: crappy in every way.
094621-0001	Disatisfied customer, I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors.
094621-0002	A&E came out, charged $129 fee just to walk in the door.
094621-0003	I needed a part for my appliance, the cost was very high so I said never mind, paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote.
094621-0004	The second vendor charged $55 (less than half of what A&E charges) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service (which A&E does not).
094621-0005	Their quote came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part.
094621-0006	Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary!
094621-0007	Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well, I thought that they pre-screened their vendors for price and quality of work, obviously they do not!
095040-0001	Extremely helpful and professional
095040-0002	As first-time home buyers, my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty, extremely helpful.
095040-0003	She worked with us for over a year, helping us find our perfect home.
095040-0004	Stephanie's knowledge of the market and properties in our price range, made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did.
095040-0005	We would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley.
095040-0006	We appreciated her patience, knowledge and kindness!
095523-0001	GREAT SERVICE AND PEOPLE!!
095523-0002	Deb Watson is the contact person and she and the rest of the staff were great!!!
095523-0003	She continues to help me when needed even if I have a service question.
095523-0004	Since I'm usually at work late Deb has stayed around to help me out when needed.
095523-0005	This was after I brought the car!!!!!
095523-0006	Service does not get any better!!!!
096340-0001	ONe of a few.
096340-0002	Hancocks is one of four fabric stores in Fort Smith.
096340-0003	We have Hobby Lobby, Just for Fun Fabrics, Walmart, and Interior Mall just inside Barling.
096340-0004	They do have a good selection of fabric and notions.
097507-0001	Best meat pies in Canada
097507-0002	If you are looking for authentic British meat pies, then look know further.
097507-0003	I especially like the Chicken Curry pie.
097507-0004	Good Food.
097507-0005	The owner/baker, "Pie Guy" is a hoot to deal with as well.
097507-0006	Mo
097548-0001	The company gets busy but you never have to wait long because they ARE orginizied, so you are in, out, and paid well for your scrap
099279-0001	excellent!

101398-0001	Disappointed
101398-0002	The Bad: I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food.
101398-0003	We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes.
101398-0004	Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists.
101398-0005	I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed.
101398-0006	If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were.
101864-0001	No complaints
101864-0002	I have no complaints about the service I received.
101864-0003	This man was polite, professional, clean and quick.
101864-0004	I never felt worried and walked away satisfied.
101972-0001	Poor service
101972-0002	If you like the drama described in popular sitcom 'Seinfeld', you will see it here.
101972-0003	We signed our name in about 6:00pm.
101972-0004	There were 3 names before us.
101972-0005	The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting.
101972-0006	However, we waited and waited and in the mean time, saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names.
101972-0007	This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “no reservation, sign your name here”.
101972-0008	I had to ask the greeter, he explained his reasons with broken English.
101972-0009	I could not understand any his reasons.
101972-0010	I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first.
101972-0011	My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you.
103519-0001	umm...
103519-0002	okay, I dont have a review, but why in the hell would you name your business something that has the initials KKK....is there something behind the scenes at this place?
103519-0003	Like I'm legitimately concerned at this point...lol
103609-0001	Great Family Fun and Bonding
103609-0002	What more can be said: "Burch's Karate is the GREATEST!"
103878-0001	You guys do everything wonderful!
103878-0002	We honestly cannot think of even 1 thing we didn't like!
103952-0001	Great
103952-0002	This is a perfect place to get your hair done.
103952-0003	I have gone there time and time again whenever I need to get my hair done or when I want a haircut.
103952-0004	When I get my hair done there, they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair.
103952-0005	The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy, but the wait is worthwhile.
104703-0001	best
104703-0002	Best pedi mani Ive ever had.
104703-0003	Darla is amazing, I would recoment her to anyone.
105237-0001	Worst place flour tortillas are always hard the beef enchiladas are discussing meat all over cooked was good many yrs ago but restaurant has gone down hill
105326-0001	How a pizza place should be!
105326-0002	+ there is a free cola with every pizza.
105518-0001	Great experience - consider checking out their puppies before buying from a breeder!
105518-0002	I adopted a 3.5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League.
105518-0003	The staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding.
105518-0004	If you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup don't forget to check out the shelters!
105518-0005	My pup has a wonderful temperment and has been a wonderful addition to my family!
105719-0001	Over priced for Mexican food
106150-0001	We love Little Farmer
106150-0002	We attend LFTD and our children LOVE it!!
106150-0003	They even want to go to school on the weekends!!
106150-0004	They are preparing my older son for kindergarten and looks forward to seeing his teacher and friends everyday.
106150-0005	My infant is content everyday when I drop off and pick up.
107292-0001	awesome bagels
107292-0002	long lines on the weekends but worth it
107608-0001	excellence in glasgow
107608-0002	Iv just had my bmw z3 rear window replaced by the guys at kelvin trimmers.
107608-0003	The team who work there are helpfull, friendly and extremely knowledgeable and will help you as much as they can with thier years of hands on practice.
107608-0004	Highly recomended.
107692-0001	Long Lines, Silly Rules, Rude Staff, Ok Food
107692-0002	The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot.
107692-0003	A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good, right?
107692-0004	I mean, that's the way it works at amusement parks: the longest lines are at the best rides.
107692-0005	Well, this may be an exception.
107692-0006	The staff taking your order and "waiting" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all.
107692-0007	I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks.
107692-0008	And don't even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is, and pardon my French, a jerk.
107692-0009	If you have gotten through ordering, dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules, you are finally presented with what you came for..some tacos that are "ok," but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle.
107692-0010	Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together.
107692-0011	I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac.
108338-0001	The internet here is terrible.
108338-0002	Like the previous poster said, the com lines are split between the entire building.
108338-0003	That's 3x worse than Qwest DSL's lowest speed offering!
108338-0004	The outward appearance makes you think this place is nice, but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap.
108338-0005	Moving out as soon as our lease is up.
108338-0006	http://www.speedtest.net/result/1155244347.png
109263-0001	I have been here 3 times and all 3 times it has been bad!
109263-0002	They have messed up my order and.... The food was just not good!
109263-0003	I had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good... :(
109263-0004	I hope they get there act together...
109263-0005	I am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see??
110441-0001	Favorite place in Tampa.
110441-0002	Update: I had to add to my review.
110441-0003	I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room.
110441-0004	AMAZING!
110441-0005	I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch.
110441-0006	Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "new" dining room.
110441-0007	Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went.
110441-0008	We were greeted again and sat promptly.
110441-0009	After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had, we knew we were in for a treat!
110441-0010	I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner.
110441-0011	AMAZING!
110441-0012	The portions were generous enough that we even took some home!
110441-0013	I have to say the value of this place always amazes me.
110441-0014	It's nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service, amazing atmosphere, and Incredible food, but not break the bank while enjoying it!
110441-0015	Bottom line is that when it's a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service.
110441-0016	Well Done!
110908-0001	Great pub
110908-0002	Had a meal in this pub and i have to say it was excellant.
110908-0003	It has to be one of the nicest pubs that i have been into in a long time, the decor is nice and it has a really nice garden and a lovely decking area.
110908-0004	Good beer good service and what more could you want.
111583-0001	All I can say is that I am glad I went in!
111583-0002	The nurses are sweet as pie and the doctor is wonderful.
111583-0003	This place is about healing, not making a buck.
111583-0004	The followup visit is FREE!!
111583-0005	After going to the hospital and paying ER prices ... there is no way I won't be back here!!
111583-0006	I will be back and telling EVERYONE about this clinic.
111583-0007	THANK YOU!!
112579-0001	My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
112579-0002	I have been eating Cuban for a long time, sandwiches mainly along with other dishes..
112579-0003	I love Cuban coffee, colada... mmmm anyways I found this place and can't stop going there, I stop in at least once a week and anytime I'm in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack.
112579-0004	The place is chill and comfortable.
112579-0005	They don't speak the best English but enough to get by.
112579-0006	They bake bread fresh daily, they don't press their sandwiches which is the way I like it, and the meat is always fresh.
112579-0007	They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat, chicken, steak, or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains.
112579-0008	And their breakfast is awesome!!
112579-0009	I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for.
112579-0010	Stop in and have a bite you won't regret it.
112579-0011	A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth!
112661-0001	Great Food Awesome food Awesome service
112661-0002	I wanted to try someplace new again.
112661-0003	This place rocked.
112661-0004	Brought my wife Deb with me and she like the Fried Crab Wontons and said they were good..
112661-0005	We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs.. good also.
112661-0006	I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great..
112661-0007	I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars.
114849-0001	Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism (received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details) and the subsequent delivery of my gift (To Split, Croatia) was as requested.
114849-0002	The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard.
114849-0003	Would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift delivery.
114849-0004	Danny (Australia)
114941-0001	Give them a try!
114941-0002	The pizzas are huge and super delicious.
114941-0003	They're our favorite pizza place to order from... and they're a local, family owned company!
114941-0004	How much better does it get?!
115029-0001	Not friendly, not helpful, overall poor customer service.
115029-0002	Definitely not going to purchase a car from here.
115566-0001	Retired
115566-0002	Dr Joseph retired.
115566-0003	Dr. Dorn is his backup.
115653-0001	Great Doctor!
115653-0002	Dr. Faris is a great doctor!
115653-0003	I would recommend him to anyone.
115653-0004	I was experiencing severe back pain to the point I could barely walk or even bare to sit.
115653-0005	I went from a pain scale of 8-9 to 0 and I was able to run in the Crim just a week later!!
116821-0001	FANFUCKINGTASTIC
116821-0002	Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford, England.
116821-0003	I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza.
116821-0004	I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant, and I have to get a whole pie.
116821-0005	I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC.
116821-0006	Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around.
116821-0007	I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL.
116821-0008	I knew I had found the real deal, big pies, sold by the slice, with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front.
116821-0009	They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano.
116821-0010	So I ordered a slice.
116821-0011	It tasted like I just flew back home.
116821-0012	I dunno how they did it, but Scottish friends--- this is THE REAL DEAL.
116821-0013	I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it.
116821-0014	That being said, I don't know how their delivery service is.
116821-0015	They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza, scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me.
117115-0001	Excellent service and quality
117115-0002	I had Hom-Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago.
117115-0003	The excellent windows have performed without any problems, but that's not why I'm writing my review.
117115-0004	Three weeks ago, burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home.
117115-0005	The intruders slit the screen of the window.
117115-0006	Next, they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer.
117115-0007	The window didn't break!
117115-0008	My next-door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light, thankfully scaring the two miscreants away (they even left their hammer behind!).
117115-0009	I called Home-Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window, and was happily surprised when they said that they weren't even going to charge me for the replacement screen...that it would be covered under their guarentee.
117115-0010	Lo and behold, they replaced the screen (which had to be ordered) yesterday and didn't charge me a dime.
117115-0011	Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me.
117115-0012	In this day and age, it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies.
117115-0013	I rarely write reviews such as this one, but they certainly deserve anyone's business!
117893-0001	Aweesome
117893-0002	Holy cow was that a delicious meal.
117893-0003	Hot, fresh, delicious.
117893-0004	Loved every bit of it. :)
118668-0001	Hidden Treasure.
118668-0002	Strip mall asian it is not!
118668-0003	Go in and you will not think you are in Chesapeake.
118668-0004	The setting feels like a Sushi bar in NYC; small, cozy, but with flair.
118668-0005	Get great service, fantastic menu, and relax.
118668-0006	Best in HR so far!
118679-0001	I really want to like this place since I work right around the corner.
118679-0002	Unfortunately, I've given it a couple of tries at different times and decided to stop going.
118679-0003	The employees don't really seem to enjoy what they are doing and it shows.
118718-0001	Great Surgeon
118718-0002	I needed wisdom teeth taken out.
118718-0003	Dr. Wallen and staff was excellent.
118718-0004	They were accomdating with my scheduled and work with my insurance to get payment for the surgery.
118718-0005	Dr. Wallen explained the procedure in detail and took his time with me.
118718-0006	Staff explained insurance procedures and was very helpful.
118718-0007	Everyone was very nice.
118770-0001	This place is clean and well run with great people.
118770-0002	The food is fresh and taste great.
118770-0003	Great value and service.
118770-0004	We will be back again and again !!
119026-0001	Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people, and the minute you steep into their school, the calm loving atmosphere takes over, and tension and worries stay outside in the street, whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice.
119026-0002	A wonderful place, if you want more than just the physical side of yoga.
119026-0003	Give yourself the gift of trying this place, to see if it fits you...
120335-0001	You can fool people
120335-0002	This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising.
120335-0003	They convince lots of people that they are a great store, when in fact they are a very average place at best, they are just another big box store like the others.
120335-0004	They offer sales that aren't really sales, mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn't, a bad attitude about return items, and on and on.
120335-0005	With higher than average prices to boot!
120335-0006	So don't get taken in, keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here.
120335-0007	On the other hand, the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work, its community action, and its interest in the public welfare.
120724-0001	it was a little to high dollar for me
120992-0001	Holly - the owner, knows exactly how to make you feel beautiful in clothes.
120992-0002	Stylish and contemporary, no matter your size or personality type.
120992-0003	She's an A+ and so are her clothes!
121342-0001	We were expecting a great experience, when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts.
121342-0002	The atmosphere was nice and very clean.
121342-0003	The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters.
121342-0004	The service was ok, our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times.
121342-0005	To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde, it was completly flavorless.
121342-0006	We should have left then.
121342-0007	We orderd our meals anyway, chimichangas,jalapeno borritos, and quesadillas.
121342-0008	Everything was bland, completely void of any spice or flavor.
121342-0009	We have never had mexican food this bad, it was just simply gross.
121342-0010	Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long.
121342-0011	I recommend La Hacienda
121556-0001	Holly is truely the best hairstylist!
121556-0002	I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years, and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here.
121556-0003	I was very pleased with my experience here.
121556-0004	All of the people were friendly and welcoming.
121556-0005	I got highlights, haircut, and a blowdry.
121556-0006	She did a great job!
121556-0007	Holly is very experienced and talented, and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat.
121556-0008	My hair looks amazing, and I get compliments all the time.
121556-0009	I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone.
121556-0010	You will not be disappointed!!!!!!
121651-0001	We love our new roof!
121651-0002	We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home.
121651-0003	Everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the crew was done.
121651-0004	We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job everyday.
121651-0005	And when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day.
121651-0006	We would not hesitate to use Spears Roofing again.
121651-0007	We have already recommended you to some of our friends!
121987-0001	BEST PLACE IN AMES
121987-0002	I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean, and in great condition!
121987-0003	I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex, also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful.
121987-0004	The fitness center was GREAT!
121987-0005	The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin, sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations.
121987-0006	I would recommend these apartments to anybody!
121987-0007	I absolutely LOVED living there.
122270-0001	Perfect Practice
122270-0002	After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish.
122270-0003	Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself, putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process, both initially and then as we went along.
122270-0004	Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them.
122270-0005	The surgery itself is slick, modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands.
122270-0006	My dental surgeon, Dr. Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established.
122270-0007	Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back .....
122270-0008	Peter
122514-0001	Decent place to stay, I would stay there again.
122514-0002	Rooms were clean, plenty of things to do near hotel, and safe part of town.
122564-0001	good outside, bad inside
122564-0002	the apartment only looks good outsize, inside is too bad.
122564-0003	too many bugs some you even never seen before.
122564-0004	the attitude of some staff is terrible, did not solve anything only say i can do nothing.
122882-0001	Over-rated
122882-0002	Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr, but that doesn't impress me.
122882-0003	The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but, the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries.
122882-0004	The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been, acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers.
122882-0005	The angry lobster was completely over-priced!
122882-0006	$80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables!
122882-0007	I wouldn't go there again.
124163-0001	Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough.
124163-0002	I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson.
124163-0003	He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free.
124163-0004	My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due!
124163-0005	In addition to the core treatment, Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well-being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient.
124163-0006	He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –

124492-0001	Great product, great service!!!
124492-0002	Installed Biometrics and Got Excellent Service.
124552-0001	They have good sushi for a good price.
124552-0002	My favorite so far in Bellevue.
124552-0003	Store is on the small side and atmosphere is just average.
125522-0001	They are out of business.
125522-0002	Nice people... I hear.
125522-0003	Calls are now forwarded to Malcolm Smith Motorsports down the road.
125629-0001	Anyone else find it a little suspicious that there are not only 20 reviews for this dentist (a HUGE number compared to the others in the area), but that they all have the same unique grammar structure?
125629-0002	And they seem to be posted at fairly regular intervals?
126086-0001	I like I Move CA - Los Angeles Movers, they moved me before, but this time they were awesome :)
126134-0001	Usually very quick and timely.
126134-0002	Doctor Bogomilsky knows her stuff too.
126171-0001	Only Concerned With Money
126171-0002	I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect.
126171-0003	The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice, but I was disappointed with their customer service.
126171-0004	Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment, even if you had an emergency.
126171-0005	It's pretty ridiculous!
126171-0006	They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident!!!!
126171-0007	They don't care one bit about you!!!!!
127157-0001	great service/deals - support this local business
127157-0002	I have used these guys for new snows, fixing lots of flats, used replacement tires, and oil changes.
127157-0003	They have the best prices locally and good customer service.
127157-0004	One guy is a little surley, but who gives a crap as long as your car's work is outstanding.
127157-0005	AND they're usually able to help you as a walk-in, and they're fast.
127157-0006	Overall-good stuff.
127252-0001	Real pros
127252-0002	I've had writer friends describe horror stories with their printers.
127252-0003	I tell them: why not just go with these guys?
127252-0004	Richard Joule and the gang are pros from start to finish.
127252-0005	They set out to exceed your expectations.
127252-0006	Already I'm considering future projects, and I can assure you that for my printing needs I will be choosing no other than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing.
128168-0001	Lovely Nails on Cayuga St. in Lewiston, NY
128168-0002	First let me start out by saying, that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road.
128168-0003	I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston, as I live in Youngstown.
128168-0004	I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life.
128168-0005	There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman.
128168-0006	I put my foot in the water and it was cool.
128168-0007	He did warm it up.
128168-0008	He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back.
128168-0009	If the pedicure lasted 20 mins., that was a stretch.
128168-0010	The other ladies had a similar experience, both had nail polish on a couple of toes.
128168-0011	None of us will be using their services again, which is a shame.
128636-0001	David is amazing
128636-0002	David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used.
128636-0003	He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation.
128636-0004	He was patient and adapted when everything didn't go according to schedule on my wedding day.
128636-0005	Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing.
128636-0006	He got the pictures back to me quickly.
128636-0007	I would highly recommend David to anyone.
128636-0008	He will exceed your expectations!
128636-0009	He doesn't just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won't even notice that there's a camera there.
128808-0001	Relish
128808-0002	A Top Quality Sandwich made to artistic standards.
128808-0003	The best darlington has to offer in contemporary sandwicheering.
128808-0004	Drum and bass as standard.
128908-0001	I love the meat!
130216-0001	Fast Service Called them one hour ago and they just left my house five minutes ago.
130216-0002	My house already feels fresh and good thanks to the Battery Park Pest I'm enjoying my time indoors much better.
130647-0001	Will never use again.
130647-0002	Very rude and unprofessional.
130647-0003	The workers sped up and down the street with no mind to the small children playing.
130795-0001	They Suck
130795-0002	Go somewhere else...
130795-0003	Wanted to buy a Rhino 700 and a Grizzly 700.
130795-0004	After searching high and low for a salesman, I was treated like dirt, and we left.
130795-0005	Parts department blows, Service department is even worse.
130795-0006	I live 10 minutes from Cycle City, but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange, dealt with the owner, Levi, and was well taken care of.
131458-0001	Signs of Saltford - an excellent supplier of value for money signs and banners etc.
131458-0002	I have been a friend and customer of Signs of Saltford for well over 12 years now and I also became their website supplier some 3 years ago.
131458-0003	Tina is the driving force of the business and you can be assured that she will endevour to satisfy all your signage requirements at the most cost effective rates.

131965-0001	Great service
131965-0002	We at R&L Plumbing Services are pleased with your professionalism and the extra mile you went to get out computers working correctly, you will be our first call if anything happens again and we will refer you to other people with computer issues.
133260-0001	Great Job!
133260-0002	Thanks for fixing my garage door A++++++++++++++++++
133601-0001	Dr. Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had.
133601-0002	You are knowledgeable, professional, gentel and kind.
133601-0003	I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now, However I am glad you are my dentist now.
133601-0004	Even though you are expensive.
133601-0005	Thank you for helping to preserve my teeth.
133601-0006	You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile.
133981-0001	Smokers Haven
133981-0002	Yeah, this complex is not very good.
133981-0003	Our bathroom fan, one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed.
133981-0004	Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up.
133981-0005	And non-smokers beware!!!
133981-0006	I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers!
133981-0007	If you do not smoke, do not move here.
133981-0008	Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in.
133981-0009	You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night.
134617-0001	Great Neighborhood Hangout
134617-0002	Great place to catch a band or catch up with friends.
134617-0003	Ice cold beer and good prices.
134617-0004	Kitchen puts out good food and has daily specials.
134622-0001	We just got our sunroom built by Patio World and can say that I'm extremely happy with the whole thing.
134622-0002	From the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote, to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself.
134622-0003	I have nothing bad to say.
134622-0004	Very glad that we went with them.
134741-0001	professional
134741-0002	Good job very professional.
134741-0003	It made me feel good to see people work so hard to take care of others belongings.
135010-0001	The New Italian Kid on the Block
135010-0002	Another Italian restaurant in Collingswood?
135010-0003	Do we need another one?
135010-0004	Only if it is of the quality of That's Amore.
135010-0005	The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch.
135010-0006	The arancini di riso (risotto fritters) are not to be missed.
135010-0007	Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there's the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven.
135010-0008	Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I'm planning on ordered a few instead of an entree.
135800-0001	Liars, negative stars!
135800-0002	Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy.
135800-0003	The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg.
135800-0004	However, they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings.
135800-0005	I wonder if they were going down a hill!
135800-0006	They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles.
135800-0007	I brought it back with 9000 miles.
135800-0008	They "finished" the work and told me the car was ready.
135800-0009	I found out they did not even drive the car, stated they looked at it before.
135800-0010	They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number.
135800-0011	They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan (a seperate issue), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms.
135800-0012	I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever.
137883-0001	Your average crappy chain.
137883-0002	Food is awful and the place caters to the yuppy crowd.
138110-0001	This is a great place to get a permit
138110-0002	I had to get a permit here, it was cool
138249-0001	These guys do great work at VERY reasonable prices.
138249-0002	I have use them four times for fixing items from pushing out a dent in a bumper to fixing the fender on my beloved Miata.
138249-0003	I have never been disappointed.
138699-0001	Great service and awesome prices.
138699-0002	I get Microdermabrasions regularly and I love the environment
139152-0001	Hospitality.!
139152-0002	Very good hospitality offered.!
139152-0003	Keep it up.
139152-0004	- Shree Ghatkopar Bhatia Mitra Mandal
139456-0001	Pleasure to work with.
139456-0002	The experience with every department has been great.
139456-0003	No complaints!
140164-0001	If you want cheaply made glass from India and China, this is not your place.
140164-0002	These people only carry the very best American blown glass.
140164-0003	Their selection is top notch and the staff is very knowledgable.
140164-0004	Go to the Looking Glass for all your smoking needs!!!!!!!!!!
140302-0001	5 star detail job
140302-0002	I took my Mustang here and it looked amazing after they were done, they did a great job, I'm very satisfied with the results.
140302-0003	The paint and wheels looked like glass and the interior looked new!
140302-0004	Also, they have great customer service and a very knowledgeable staff
141103-0001	Good location
141103-0002	For a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet.
141103-0003	What you get is a $13/day charge to access the internet through a slow 512/512kb/s that you can only use to check email etc (Read: No downloading).
141103-0004	Other than that the hotel is in a good location and the breakfast is great
142081-0001	Fantastic Service!
142081-0002	I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires, alignment and state inspection done yesterday.
142081-0003	I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage.
142081-0004	It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires!
142081-0005	What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride.
142081-0006	Great service, great pricing and SUPER CONVENIENT!
142081-0007	I also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that I did not need.
145645-0001	spoken english rushi
145645-0002	can ever & never forget the training undergone here which made my life step onto the successful job without any hurdles.
145645-0003	The staff, material provided, infra structure, environment &low fees totally above the satisfactory mark
146820-0001	Amazing service!
146820-0002	I just had the best experience at this Kal Tire location.
146820-0003	Courteous, fast and friendly.
147825-0001	Rip Off!
147825-0002	45p for tap water!
147825-0003	Ridiculous!
147825-0004	Don't think I've ever been charged before.
147825-0005	Oh, and salad cream, not mayonnaise, on the coleslaw.
147825-0006	Avoid!
148012-0001	Great lunch specials.
148012-0002	Delivery is lightning fast.
148012-0003	Perfect since I'm on a budget.
148012-0004	But otherwise, it can feel pricey for what you get.
148012-0005	Like the sushi, don't like the pad thai.
148346-0001	Best place to sleep!!!!!!!
148566-0001	Good fun for wing night, food eh, beer list eh...
148971-0001	Dr. Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
148971-0002	I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there, but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word, and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING!!
148971-0003	He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis.
148971-0004	I had a surgery date of July 17, 2008.
148971-0005	Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy, even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery (as he had twice stated i must agree to).
148971-0006	He later said that by 2 months he "meant at least two months".
148971-0007	Two months and at least two months are totally different things.
148971-0008	He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer, which i would have.
148971-0009	A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed.
148971-0010	He also never even said he was sorry.
148971-0011	Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room.
148971-0012	So, therefore, now he says i am inoperable (even though i am not 100% inoperable), and he is letting me die.
148971-0013	I am just middle aged and do not want to die, but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives.
148971-0014	I, along with my friends, consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating.
148971-0015	Even my PA i went to the other day said "it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you".
148971-0016	He said it sarcastically.
148971-0017	If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind, and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need, when they will not work for you, go to this doctor...he is the one for you.
149741-0001	It's helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting.
149741-0002	If you watch a lot of fights (youtube) and research some of the history (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting) you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more!
149741-0003	Also after seeing a handful of bullfights, I can say that they're a lot more enjoyable if you're smashed (BAC>= .15).
149922-0001	Clean rooms, great for the price and cheapest on the exit.
149922-0002	The front desk staff was very pleasant and efficient.
149922-0003	Serves FREE breakfast !
150192-0001	There are so many wonderful great places to dine in houston....don't.waste your time here.
150192-0002	I had the morelias enchiladas.
150192-0003	The sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good.at all.
150192-0004	In fact my friend vomited after our meal.
150192-0005	Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor.
150192-0006	Service was okay not great, we came for a late lunch.
150192-0007	I don't recommend this place.
152281-0001	Great Service, Thanks Don.
152281-0002	Nice Top Lights.
153921-0001	Fresh and Excellent Quality
153921-0002	We order take out from here all the time and we are never disappointed.
153921-0003	The food is always fresh and delicious.
153921-0004	It can be a little on the spicy side but just ask them exactly what you want and they are very helpful.
154113-0001	A good cut!
154113-0002	Cécile is a hairdresser and has just moved into the neighbourhood.
154113-0003	I go to see her to have my hair cut.
154157-0001	FAST and reasonable$
154157-0002	We went to Kobeys on Saturday and had our whole teams uniforms done!
154157-0003	He was less than half of the price of the cheapest quote we got, and his work was top notch.
154157-0004	Down to earth and fast service.
154157-0005	Going back to have some lab coats done this weekend!
154658-0001	Great out night!
154658-0002	You can't go wrong with Tuesday prices, even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians!
154658-0003	Extensive drink list and daily specials but wish they had a bit more on their food menu, although popcorn is a nice touch!
154658-0004	(other items: chicken fingers, wings, asian pizza, and yam and regular fries)
155050-0001	amazing, fun, great beers.
155050-0002	service could be a little better but its an all round good place
156460-0001	Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon!!!
156460-0002	I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years.
156460-0003	I cannot tell you how often I am complimented on my hair (style AND color)!
156460-0004	I regularly request Kim's business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "Who does your hair...I LOVE it!!!"
156460-0005	Quaint, lovely, small salon with BIG personality.
156460-0006	I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience.
156460-0007	My hair has never felt this healthy, either.
156460-0008	I cannot recommend this salon enough!!!
156460-0009	Thanks Cheveux!
156953-0001	wonderful
156953-0002	I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews.
156953-0003	I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut.
156953-0004	I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment.
156953-0005	Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did.
156953-0006	I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style.
156953-0007	It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly.
156953-0008	Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state.
156953-0009	But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home.
156953-0010	It wasn't completly impossible!!!!
156953-0011	I am definitely going back
158285-0001	Restaurant on top was renovated, food was decent, price was way to high for Duluth for quality, new decor seems tacky
158335-0001	junkie lube?!
158335-0002	really weird place, I was driving home from work thought I'd stop in for an oil change and well, there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze.
158335-0003	The neon lighting sign still said "on" yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch, more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they'd be open tomorrow.
158335-0004	I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was.
158335-0005	WOW!
158335-0006	grey shirt "mark" of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someonelses clothing.....
158740-0001	awesome place!!!
158740-0002	it was worth of the ride more than an hour...
158740-0003	I had so many strawberries right on the field...strongly recomend...dont forget to try their great ice cream

159371-0004	the knights inn was small very small.i mean 1 room in every room!it was cozy a little and a small tv.
159371-0005	i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York.
159371-0006	but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review

160073-0001	Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
160073-0002	My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food.
160073-0003	Well it took us a while to find one that we liked.
160073-0004	But we don't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT.
160073-0005	Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to--and trust me we have been to a lot of them.
160073-0006	We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road.
160073-0007	We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back.
160073-0008	They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted.
160073-0009	We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls.
160073-0010	And every entree we have ordered is perfect.
160073-0011	Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh.
160073-0012	Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive.
160073-0013	The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with.
160073-0014	They are also quick at getting your order out to you.
160073-0015	You don't have to sit and wait around forever like most places!!
160073-0016	So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things---You won't regret it!!
160073-0017	and you will go back for more!!!
160073-0018	Karla Ferguson-Granger
160073-0019	PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends" and I will tell you that I don't know these people except from eating at their restaurant.
160073-0020	We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago.
160073-0021	So that comment is completely false.
160073-0022	Because we think IT'S THE BEST!!!
160073-0023	and we don't know them except for eating there.
160442-0001	Extremely bad customer service
160442-0002	Do not go to this salon, especially if you have to get your hair straightened.
160442-0003	They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it didn't work for my hair.
160442-0004	Rude, insensitive, discourteous people!!!!!
162253-0001	Over charged.
162253-0002	I used my card to purchase a meal on the menu and the total on my receipt was $8.95 but when I went on line to check my transaction it show $10.74.
162253-0003	There is something wrong or maybe the individual made a mistake but to me that is not integrity.
162422-0001	Horrible.
162422-0002	Horrible.
162422-0003	When we walked in, the person behind desk said: "oh well, you must wait, I am in the middle of something."
162422-0004	After a good few minutes, he asked: "what do you want?"
162422-0005	Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked.
162422-0006	I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms.
162422-0007	He immediately said "no, there is a $50 deposit now!"
162422-0008	Sure enough he charged it to the credit card.
162422-0009	When I inquired he rudely replied "in the morning when things are checked out you'll get it back."
162422-0010	I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check-in.
162422-0011	I also mentioned to the reception person.
162422-0012	He responded "we have problem with 'people'".
162422-0013	Imagine a hotel having problems with people.
162422-0014	I finally alerted him to his rudeness.
162422-0015	He said he's had a long and bad day.
162422-0016	We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can.
162422-0017	Don't stay there.
162422-0018	I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also.
162567-0001	Highly Recommend
162567-0002	I have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed.
162567-0003	No matter what state I am in when I arrive, I always leave feeling better.
162567-0004	She has not only helped me through some challenging computer-work and sports related injuries, she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond.
162567-0005	I highly recommend her.
162662-0001	Great place for embroidery.
162662-0002	Service was friendly and VERY fast.
162662-0003	I purchased four gift items there and had them all embroidered within a week.
162702-0001	The best photographer in Miami
162702-0002	I was soooo lucky to have used Marlon's photography services....such a creative and talented photographer and a pleasure to work with.
162702-0003	The images turned out amazing.
162702-0004	I definitely recommend him :)
162992-0001	Great Service and hairstyles that last.
162992-0002	I am pleased with the service that i get at Luxe.
162992-0003	The staff is very pleasant and my hair is always fresh.
163250-0001	Great service
163250-0002	These people were so helpful this week and did everything to sort out my windscreen and insurance.
163250-0003	It was all sorted with no hassle at all and I'm really grateful - they were fab.
163250-0004	The best customer service I've come across for long time.
163703-0001	Cheap Hotel Rome - Thanks for all your help!
163703-0002	Cheap Hotel Rome - thanks for finding us a hotel at the last minute.
163703-0003	We had a great stay, your service was excellent and we will use you again!
164580-0001	For cheap Chinese food, this is the place to go.
164580-0002	I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy, MO - nothing terrible but not that great.
164580-0003	Now, I won't eat fast food Chinese unless it's from this place.
164580-0004	The best value I've found from a Chinese restaurant.
164580-0005	I don't live in Lake St. Louis anymore, but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous.
164580-0006	Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin' :sadface:
164805-0001	My 2004 x-type was getting close to 100,000 miles so it was time for an upgrade.
164805-0002	I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre-owned 2009 XF.
164805-0003	Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out.
164805-0004	I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael.
164805-0005	He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive.
164805-0006	I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade-in and the price of the 09 XF.
164805-0007	The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes.
164805-0008	Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides.
164805-0009	10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre-owned 09 XF.
164805-0010	I have purchased over 15 vehicles (cars, rvs, and boats) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best.
164805-0011	Friendly, knowledgeable, and above all fair.
164805-0012	That's all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3.
164805-0013	Thanks for the great deal and the great car!
164937-0001	Super nice people, really good food
164937-0002	What I love most about this place, other than the food, is that eating here makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than Baltimore.
164937-0003	The owners are really nice, they serve good food at a good price, and the option to eat outside on the deck (esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic) is great.
164937-0004	One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore.
165018-0001	Run for the hills ... you'll be much better off!
165018-0002	One night was too much.
165018-0003	First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified.
165018-0004	I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty, the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it, the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould.
165018-0005	I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told "This is a Days Inn, not the Hilton" and the receptionist then hung up on me.
165018-0006	To warn you to stay away from this place just isn't enough.
165018-0007	There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned.
165032-0001	Michael helped shoot the majority of my firm's website and we could not have been happier.
165032-0002	We went through six photographers to find the right photographers that would represent our firm in the light we wished to and Michael and his team made that happen.
165032-0003	He's worth every penny.
165143-0001	They won't have a second chance from me.
165143-0002	First, let me state that although I live in NYC, I am not from NYC, I don't care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death (so beautiful, so clean, so awesome).
165143-0003	That said, I hated this restaurant.
165143-0004	The service was just about as good as I'd get in NYC (that means it was poor) and the food was almost mediocre.
165143-0005	The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality.
165143-0006	Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
166983-0001	The pancakes are to die for.
169083-0001	I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great.
169083-0002	I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital.
169083-0003	Yes, we had to wait, but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first.
169083-0004	Any ER would be the same.
169083-0005	As far as being treated like a drug seeker, that has not been my experience.
169083-0006	As a nurse I know about drug seekers.
169083-0007	This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system.
169610-0001	house closing
169610-0002	Mrs. Tolchin provided us with excellent service and came with a great deal of knowledge and professionalism!
169610-0003	Her flexibility and accessibility made for an easy closing.
170650-0001	NEVER fear going to the dentist again!
170650-0002	I'm 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life.
170650-0003	By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist.
170650-0004	My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me!
170650-0005	It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment.
170650-0006	At the front door of his office, I nearly turned around.
170650-0007	I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did.
170650-0008	Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with.
170650-0009	They made me feel confident in what they would do, and treated me like a member of their own family.
170650-0010	I never felt pain or discomfort.
170650-0011	The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life.
170650-0012	Thank you Doctor Gonzales, Doctor Stout, Eva Marie and the entire staff!

171255-0001	what a mindblowing servicing
171255-0002	They treat there employees with respect and concern and expect that they will extend the same politeness to there customers.

173944-0005	Good Job DR.
174824-0001	Yeah they ruined some shirts I had too.
174824-0002	Horrible!
175434-0001	This is a Ralph's
175434-0002	I just called this number and it is a Ralph's Market.
177779-0001	Brain Dead
177779-0002	Not only are these people completely inefficient and ineffective, but they just don't give a darn.
177779-0003	This place is a complete embarrassment.
178726-0001	Excellent medical care!!!!!!
178726-0002	Highly recommend
178726-0003	I went to this urgent care center and was blown away with their service.
178726-0004	Finally a convenient place close to home.
178726-0005	Wonderful staff and physician.
178726-0006	Clean and superb.
178726-0007	Thanks for the great care!!!!
178726-0008	Will definitely go back when I need medical care.
180886-0001	Wonderful Experience
180886-0002	I had immense pain on a Sunday morning, with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday.
180886-0003	Dr. Taylor was not only available on a Sunday, but also was able to immediately take care of me.
180886-0004	He was incredibly informative about the options I had, giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from.
180886-0005	Coming from a person who hates the dentist in general, Dr. Taylor was the best!
180886-0006	He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service!
180886-0007	I would recommend him to everyone!

181748-0001	Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
181748-0002	I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here.
181748-0003	My experience was awful though.
181748-0004	It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks.
181748-0005	I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it, but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal.
181748-0006	Essentially, I told him I didn't trust him cause he was a car salesman, but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back.
181748-0007	I don't know if the kid had a bad day or what, but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue.
181748-0008	After that, I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car.
181748-0009	I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods.
181748-0010	For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM, which isn't true.
181748-0011	I mean, I don't care if he doesn't know, but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face, there's no way I'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing.
181771-0001	the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat!
181771-0002	I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis.
181771-0003	I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her.
181771-0004	I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager.
181771-0005	I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog, I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention.
181771-0006	We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying, " was I gotta have it!"
181771-0007	I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier.
181771-0008	Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer.
181771-0009	Definitely go see them!
182354-0001	Prominent Builders NJ
182354-0002	Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors, I was referred to them by my friend, I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation, and addition.
182354-0003	They were very professional, respectful, completed the Job on time, and well below my budget.
182354-0004	Mike one of owners was awesome, he explained the detailed plan, and executed on time, I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me.
183172-0001	DO NOT GO HERE!!!
183172-0002	I went to get my nails filled Friday, by Monday 2 were broken.
183172-0003	I was not happy with the way they looked, very wavy, uneven edges, and with the exception of 1, there is a dip in the center of each nail.
183172-0004	I also had a pedicure, and they cut my nails too short, one of my big toes looks like its getting infected.
183518-0001	An Asset to Richmond
183518-0002	For a long time, one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first-run multiplex.
183518-0003	Bowtie has filled that role nicely.
183518-0004	The theatre is in an old brick warehouse, which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium.
183518-0005	The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there.
183518-0006	The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood.
183518-0007	There's plenty of parking, and I've never had an issue with audience members who won't stop talking or answering their cellphones.
183518-0008	Best of all, there are no ads!!!!!
183518-0009	Just previews and the main feature.
183518-0010	Expect to pay full price, and the theatres themselves are on the small side.
183518-0011	But if you like going to the movies, you should love Bowtie.
183518-0012	The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays, you can get a beer in the lobby, and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card.
183518-0013	A great cinema in a great location.
183518-0014	Thank you, Bowtie!
184290-0001	wow wow wow.
184290-0002	the bast cab in minneapolis
184731-0001	The World's Fair museum was pretty cool.
185045-0001	Rcommended by bees, too!
185045-0002	Highly recommended.
185045-0003	Joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt, friendly and informative service.
185045-0004	No spraying of pesticides!
185045-0005	Very professional.
185045-0006	Reasonable rate.
185045-0007	We highly recommend Joe and his wasp removal service to individual home owners and condos.
185045-0008	He knows his bees!
185045-0009	Suzanne, Vancouver
186135-0001	Too Expensive
186135-0002	The food's okay, but the price is outrageous.
186235-0001	wow, the representative went way above and beyond in helping me with my account set up.
186235-0002	i wish the other utilities i had to set up had people to work with like this..
186275-0001	:)
186275-0002	I will gladly recommend you to anyone in need of or looking for a good florist.
186284-0001	Superb Arrangements
186284-0002	I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband's funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me.
186284-0003	I am so glad that I called in to see Ana, she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me.
186284-0004	The flowers were all that I hoped they would be, I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all.
186284-0005	She is so talented, the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately, it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others.
186284-0006	Thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstances.
187163-0001	Linda
187163-0002	I would highly recommend Landscape by Hiro.
187163-0003	Excellent customer service and quality work.
187266-0001	Wish this was in Saratoga--
187266-0002	We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler-professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world-- and residing in Paris,London, New York the rest of the year.
187266-0003	SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES.
187266-0004	She was dead on-- this restaurant was wonderful--- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page.
187266-0005	I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent.
187266-0006	Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food.
187266-0007	This chef knows what he is doing.
187266-0008	Treat yourself and go-- you will go back!
187266-0009	I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town!
187266-0010	The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices!
187266-0011	Unlike Saratoga.
187266-0012	I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself-- but the second time we went-- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were.
187266-0013	Cannot wait to go gain.
187266-0014	-R. Morris .
187875-0001	BAD COFFEE, DONT BOTHER!
187875-0002	Can't you make a decent cup of coffee?
187875-0003	You charge SO MUCH, yet you use the same grounds over and over again.
187875-0004	The coffee taste BURNT and very bitter.
187875-0005	No amount of sugar and milk can mask it.
187875-0006	CHANGE THE PROCESS, PPL!
187875-0007	Westfield and Rt 1 do it well, WHY CANT U????
188382-0001	This is a great place to shop.
188382-0002	I've been a regular customer at this store since it opened, and love the fact that all of the employees are friendly locals.
188382-0003	Particularly the lady who operates the front register, she's very kind!
188461-0001	Totally flavored
188461-0002	The statement about "best hamburguers in town" can be even amplifiaed to "best hamburguers in world" Totally worth, juicy, big, fresh, and excellent customer service!
188548-0001	Good food, good wait staff, poor management
188548-0002	We visited on 7/26/08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia's on Greenfield Ave.
188548-0003	The food was good, and so was our waitress.
188548-0004	When it came time to pay the bill up front, they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip (which I have done with any other restaurant I've gotten a gift certificate for.)
188548-0005	I then asked if I could have money back in cash.
188548-0006	The person went to go check with the manager, who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there.
188548-0007	Her answer was short and manner rather rude.
188548-0008	Sorry for interrupting I guess.
188548-0009	The cashier was also short, unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time.
188548-0010	There were no other options available (I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy.
188548-0011	I will not be visiting Mama Mia's again.
188548-0012	There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more.
189171-0001	A most outstanding, professional firm.
190256-0001	I was thoroughly impressed!
190256-0002	I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart.
190256-0003	I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren't the cheapest I found but very reasonable.
190256-0004	The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company's were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures.
190256-0005	They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy.
190256-0006	We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over- who would have guessed that one?
190256-0007	Very nice work and friendly guys too.
190256-0008	Best money I've spent on remodeling ever.
190256-0009	I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call.
190389-0001	very miss informed people!!
191597-0001	Awsome!

191597-0004	Fish tacos are my fave simple and filling Highly recommend Mi Pueblo.
191597-0005	Gets busy so come early
191666-0001	Worst Service I've Ever Experienced
191666-0002	I wish there was something good to say about the business, but unfortunately, there isn't.
191666-0003	1) Service and manners were nonexistent.
191666-0004	2) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative.
191666-0005	(to both myself and customers) 3) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business.
191666-0006	4) The business is very unorganized.
191666-0007	The invoice is not detailed, so it is difficult to see what you are paying for.
191666-0008	I'd recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store.
192399-0001	Kyle with Bullwark
192399-0002	Great job!

192713-0001	The finest Christmas Trees i've ever seen.
192713-0002	I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm.
192713-0003	The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding.
192713-0004	The owners were entertaining and gracious.
192713-0005	I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals.
192713-0006	This is one of the best farms I have ever been too.
192713-0007	I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast!
192713-0008	It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard, got myself a woman like Jerry, and became a republican.
192713-0009	Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation!
192737-0001	Professional and inspiring
192737-0002	Nigel from Nidd Design has always provided a first class service, from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawings and planning applications.

192737-0004	Once you have met Nigel you will not want to work with anyone else.
192737-0005	He really does turn your dreams into reality for your home!
193257-0001	Gets the Job Done
193257-0002	We have utilized Mr. Pozza and his firm twice now in our family and both times have been very pleased.
193257-0003	I would not hesitate to use him again or refer him to my family or friends.

194313-0005	Highly recommended.
194316-0001	OMG
194316-0002	OMG.. make sure to book a reservation, as this magical place is packed (in a nice way) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food.
194316-0003	The waiters are like no other...
194316-0004	My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75% tip, and it was worht every penny..
194316-0005	The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic..
194316-0006	I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice.
194830-0001	impressive truly impressive
194830-0002	The First time I walked in there with my teacup chihuahua puppy I knew I'd be here a lot.
194830-0003	Pets Discount has lovely employees, a wonderful grooming service, and everything I need to keep my dog in tip top condition!
196219-0001	ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES.
196219-0002	IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE, MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI.
196219-0003	SO, IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES, WELL, IT IS OK.
196219-0004	IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD.
196219-0005	IF YOU WANT A STEAK, WELL, THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY.
196219-0006	OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK, THIS IS NOT IT.
198455-0001	Great service
198455-0002	I had a dead battery last week and called this company since they were the closest they had very quick service for a Monday morning, thanks again guys.
199045-0001	green curry and red curry is awesome!
199045-0002	remember to ask for extra vege
200429-0001	Horrible Service!
200429-0002	I got yelled at, literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5-10 minutes late.
200429-0003	I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am, but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5:30.
200429-0004	Rude, unprofessional, just jerks.
200429-0005	Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time, NO care for the customers AT ALL!!!
200429-0006	Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless.
200429-0007	I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again.
200566-0001	THE TEACHING THERE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
200566-0002	ALL OF THE TEACHERS THERE ARE SO MEAN THEY GET MAD AT YOU FOR NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
200566-0003	THIS IS THE WORST SCHOOL IVE BEEN TO!!!!!!
200668-0001	kudos to Allentown Post Office staff
200668-0002	The staff in Allentown are friendly, helpful and a delight to know..
200957-0001	Horrible
200957-0002	I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off.
200957-0003	I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top, 2 inch long hair on the sides, and 1.5 in the back.
200957-0004	My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous.
200957-0005	This woman should be working in supercuts...if that.
200957-0006	This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that.
200957-0007	Do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment.
201156-0001	PHOTOS DONE WELL
201156-0002	I Love Hellada Gallery!
201156-0003	Marek Dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business - If you are into old fashion (Not Digital) quality photography this is best place in Long Beach as I think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore I know Marek personaly and I will always recommend him
201972-0001	Great help even near closing time!
201972-0002	I came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers!
201972-0003	Oh no!!
201972-0004	I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful.
201972-0005	They spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes.
201972-0006	I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year!
201972-0007	Thanks Run on!
202402-0001	SERVERS
202402-0002	When my server crashed, Greg worked from 7 PM until 4 AM and had my company up and running the next morning.
202402-0003	That's what I call customer service!
202709-0001	Elmira, your the best!
202709-0002	All I can say is that Elmira you are the best Ive experienced, never before has the seamstress done a perfect job until i met you.
202709-0003	I recommend you to everyone in Calgary, as she is a professional and the cost for her was low.
203196-0001	VINGAS

206303-0001	Natasha
206303-0002	A real pleasure training with Natasha.
206303-0003	Always professional and reliable, sessions are good fun and suitably challenging.
206303-0004	She really listens to what it is you would like to achieve, and I am very happy with my results.
206303-0005	I would highly recommend her services.
207348-0001	Feels like you are in Brooklyn, but people watching is entertaining.
207629-0001	highly recommended.
207629-0002	I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone.
207629-0003	I've read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes, like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait (depending on what other patients are being seen for) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly (just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance)...
207629-0004	I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration.
207629-0005	I cant speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us (the patient) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you.
207629-0006	I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice...Warner Family is the place for you.
207783-0001	Not a clothing store
207783-0002	Be more careful when you write reviews- this is an accounting group, not Hollister the clothing store.
208180-0001	Good quality Indian food in a pleasant environment
208310-0001	Whatever you order, you will LOVE!
209465-0001	Pho-nomenal!!
209465-0002	I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I've always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown, but when i tried this pho place, it blew the other pho houses away!!
209465-0003	all of the pho places taste the same to me, so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price.
209465-0004	The service here is incredible compared to the other places.
209465-0005	the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown.
209465-0006	remember to bring cash since they don't take debit or credit.
209465-0007	hope this helps!!
210019-0001	We have stayed at Tanglewood for many years now.
210019-0002	We go over about 5 times a year.
210019-0003	We have never had a problem with the cabins.
210019-0004	They are always so helpful.
210019-0005	The cabins have always been clean.
210019-0006	Helen is a wonderful place to take you family.
210019-0007	We recommend these cabins!
210066-0001	Bait and switch, untrained workers
210066-0002	Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago, before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile... was told I would need a "dual head concrete grinder" to remove thinset and make a nice "finished" look (ready for concrete stain).
210066-0003	Was quoted $55 all inclusive of grinder inserts, etc.
210066-0004	No problem, sounded like it's done every day.
210066-0005	Will look beautiful.
210066-0006	Got the tile ripped out, call today, now all the sudden this grinder won't leave a finished look AND it's $125 PLUS around $75 for the inserts.
210066-0007	I can rent another machine for like $60 that will give it a finished look.
210066-0008	So from $55 to $260?
210066-0009	Are they serious?
210066-0010	I feel like they didn't tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price?
210066-0011	Either these people don't know anything about what they are renting, or worse- they are bait and switching.
210153-0001	Poor Taste
210153-0002	There is no lower rating for Noonan's Liquor, owners and employees.
210153-0003	A negative number is not available.
210153-0004	CLH
210875-0001	Bulwark regarding service by Eric
210875-0002	Just wanted you to know that Eric came by as scheduled today and sprayed our house for scorpions.
210875-0003	He seemed to understand how important it was for us to make sure the whole house was sprayed so he took his time.
210875-0004	Thank you!
211709-0001	Best ceviche that I'd had so far! :)
211797-0001	MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store.
211797-0002	At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses.
211797-0003	They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses.
211797-0004	I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model (by looking the dress up online).
211797-0005	So, as I was leaving I asked for the designer/dress name or style number associated with my top picks.
211797-0006	They said they were "unable to tell me until they ordered my dress".
211797-0007	Hmmm... A person cannot call a company, if you have no idea its name (since the designer is unknown... SUPPOSEDLY), and order a gown without a dress name or style number.
211797-0008	Do other brides fall for this???
211797-0009	They either: a) don't want to give it to me because they don't want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b) are recreating the dresses themselves (ie STEALING other designers' dress designs and "filling the orders" by their own seamstresses).
211797-0010	I'm no detective but... uhh... seriously?!?
211797-0011	Whatever type of operation they are running, I'm not interested and if you're smart, you won't be either.
211797-0012	What a waste of TIME.
211797-0013	Aside from that little *mystery*, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on.
211797-0014	Somehow, since she supposedly doesn't know any names of designers/dresses, after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing, she knew "exactly which dress" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on.
211797-0015	My point: Even if I was wrong, don't sit there and argue with the customer.
211797-0016	Say something like, "Huh.
211797-0017	I didn't think so but you could be right."
211797-0018	Unless you want to take the "tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she's obviously not loving" approach which will likely get you... uh... nowhere.
211797-0019	Seriously: do not waste your time.
211797-0020	Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners.
211797-0021	Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service.
211797-0022	I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life.
211844-0001	Favorite DD spot in the area!
211933-0001	Deep tissue massage helps with pain in neck and shoulders
211933-0002	Seth provides deep tissue massage which has significantly reduced the pain in my neck and shoulders and added flexibility and movement back to the area.
211933-0003	He listens and is excellent in diagnosing, addressing and explaining the specific issues and suggesting exercises to use.
212369-0001	Place is legit.
212369-0002	We got upgraded to a corner suite!
212369-0003	Room was amazing.
214912-0001	I have used Bright Futures for the last 7 years.
214912-0002	I have 3 children there and they are the Best.
214912-0003	They are like family.
214912-0004	Your children will be taken care of and loved by a professional staff.
215460-0001	Beware of Sharayu
215460-0002	Hopless service, at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised.
215460-0003	Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint.
215460-0004	My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you dont!!!
216281-0001	On time, Clean and very nice
216281-0002	I called over the weekend due to clogged kitchen sink.
216281-0003	Scheduled appointment for 8:30 Monday morning.
216281-0004	Rich was here before the scheduled time.
216281-0005	He was very clean, very nice to work with and gave a very reasonable price.
216281-0006	HIGHLY recommend.
216281-0007	thanks Rich
216281-0008	Seth K.
216456-0001	My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night, catch up on our lives evening.
216456-0002	We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night.
216456-0003	Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this.
216456-0004	My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her.
216456-0005	They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours.
216456-0006	I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn't budge.
216456-0007	Times are hard, I know, but they had no compassion.
216456-0008	I called 3 times to talked to a manager, never a call back.
216456-0009	I emailed 4 times, never a response.
216456-0010	In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet's that expressed their sympathy, this hotel did nothing.
216456-0011	I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing.
216456-0012	I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews, but if something unexpected happens in your life, they will not care.
217359-0001	This insurance co. Is a joke !!!
217359-0002	They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
217359-0003	if you don't mind being robbed ,cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
217359-0004	They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
217359-0005	They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
217359-0006	as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
217359-0007	I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
217359-0008	Ifa is an acronym for Im a F%#king Assh@%$e !!!
217485-0001	I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from this place, but they really did do a good job.
217485-0002	The chicken cordon-blu was tasty and came in a huge portion size for the money.
217485-0003	Service was a touch slow, but friendly.
217542-0001	OMFG
217542-0002	I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE EVERY TIME i GO THIS HOT CHICK SHOWS UP AND i MEAN REALLY HOT BUT SHE IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER CHICK THAT IS REALY UGLY BUT SHE IS LIKE SUPER SMART SHE COULD BE A SCIENTIST, BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS STONER WHO ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING DOG WHO IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE I THINK HE IS TRYING TO TALK.
217542-0003	ANYWAY WE DRIVE AROUND IN MY VAN AND SOLVE MYSTERYS AND SHIT
217747-0001	exelent Job
217747-0002	"Thank you so much for the superior job well done.
217747-0003	We love everything about the fence.
217747-0004	You company and services will be recommended by us to everyone."
219262-0001	Furnace repair
219262-0002	Tiger Heating is awesome.
219262-0003	I had John and Dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced.
219262-0004	These guys were absolutely professional.
219262-0005	John was here in 45 minutes after I called on a 10 below zero early Sunday morning.
219262-0006	If you need someone to help you out with your heating problems, I DEFINITELY would call TIGER HEATING and AIR.
219262-0007	Absolutely a wonderful company.
219262-0008	My family and I thank you!!!!!!!!!!
219984-0001	never response the phone call
220214-0001	I think that there pretty good.
220214-0002	First of all, if you call for an appointment they won't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one.
220214-0003	They also don't tell you that they're going to mail you an "application" to be admitted to be a patient.
220214-0004	I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I'm happy that these guys don't do those two things in particlular.
220214-0005	Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week.
220214-0006	The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that's a common misconception (http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm).
220214-0007	In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice.
220214-0008	But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why.
220214-0009	Anyhow, after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles.
220214-0010	If you want miracles you'll have to go to 21st St.
220214-0011	It's a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it's very good.
220214-0012	They don't do certain things that are really annoying about other offices.
221664-0001	This place is a Rip-Off
221664-0002	I brought a car in to have the "check engine" light diagnosed back in March of 2010.
221664-0003	They said it was "plugs and wires" and quoted me $330 to do the work, including parts.
221664-0004	I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way.
221664-0005	Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank (1 screw) and the air filter canister (4 spring clips).
221664-0006	I did the work myself for $50.
221664-0007	There's no excuse for that kind of estimate.
223040-0001	I love this place lots of people to talk to and school is across the street!
223912-0001	The staff do occasionally get game info correct, but if your looking fot a good game and aren'ta nerd, dont ask them.
223912-0002	The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps.
223912-0003	I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn'ta fps.
223912-0004	He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue.
223912-0005	Overall they aren't very knowledge about the type of games are on the market.
224117-0001	Drove all the way over from the highway... closed at 7.
224117-0002	Who does that?!
224123-0001	ok
224123-0002	can't remember good or bad, so it must have been meh.
224906-0001	First and Last time we'll eat there
224906-0002	My friend and I went there for lunch today.
224906-0003	Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we'd try it.
224906-0004	BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold.
224906-0005	We both kept trying to find something we liked.
224906-0006	The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges, I finally gave up, he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful.
224906-0007	Would NOT recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save your money and go somewhere else.
225632-0001	FHS is a good high school -- c/o 1998
225632-0002	I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School.
225632-0003	We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs, with multiple hoods and access to good equipment; nice gymnasiums, and a well-funded music department (I was in the guitar ensemble).
225632-0004	Now, of course, there's a new building, with presumably better facilities.
225632-0005	All to the good.
225632-0006	For those who care, a good proportion of the my class went on to 4-year colleges, many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News.
225632-0007	If I remember, students went to Dartmouth, U.Penn, Duke, BU, William and Mary, Vassar, Howard, and Carnegie Mellon, among others.
225632-0008	Many students went to Rutgers, including their top-ranked pharmacy program.
225632-0009	The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college, but you need to work hard.
225861-0001	My favorite place...
225861-0002	My daughter and I stayed here again from the 7th to the 14th of December.
225861-0003	yet again it was a great stay from begiinning to end.
225861-0004	Okay our room was at times noisy but we were in a mega busy city at an extremely busy time of year.

227515-0001	BEST DENTIST EVER -
227515-0002	Very fast and efficient service.
227515-0003	I have had several dentists in my life, but Dr. Deters is by far my favorite.
227515-0004	I never wait in the waiting room more than two minutes and the cleanings are quick and painless.
227605-0001	Good local steakhouse, I recommend it!
228154-0001	Good food and coffee with a nice atmosphere
228731-0001	prepared the road test with a driving ... prepared the road test with a driving school in edmonton, but my instructor only trained me in a narrow street, hence I took one 90 minute lesson from the Noble driving school to learn the skill of changing lane, and found them very friendly and professional.
228944-0001	Best in Memphis
228944-0002	This shop is by far the best I have been to.
228944-0003	I have a Saab...which everything is expensive on and they have been extrememly fair and price alot lower than any other shop I called.
228944-0004	They are the only place I would take my car peiod.
229100-0001	Great Place!
229100-0002	Love this place!!
229100-0003	Has another store in the st. charles mall.
229100-0004	Place is next to carval and walmart.
229100-0005	Dont go to the one by pepco, I got confused!!!
229100-0006	Bad place.
229100-0007	Go to ATLANTIC WIRELESS!!
229100-0008	I love them!!!
229142-0001	I used Birdies for our Annual Walk Against Drugs and Alcohol event.
229142-0002	They were very professional, neat and clean.
229142-0003	They came through on all of their promises and we had a very successful day.
229142-0004	I will be using Bridies again.
229410-0001	The Worst Experience Ever!!!
229410-0002	I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You, and it started out as a decent experience.
229410-0003	He was referred to me by a friend, who didn't have the best experience with Ted, but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end.
229410-0004	I figure I would give this company a chance.
229410-0005	However, after giving a required $500.00 (NON REFUNDABLE) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas, I was sorry I did.
229410-0006	We met a couple of weeks later, Ted was late.
229410-0007	He brought fabric books, and pictures of furniture only, which all came way over budget.
229410-0008	By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with, there was basically no design.
229410-0009	Just curtains and a couple of accessories.
229410-0010	WHAT IS THAT?????
229410-0011	This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it.
229410-0012	Please everyone....take heed and don't get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget...
229410-0013	This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
229442-0001	nice friendly local bagel place
229442-0002	there might be bigger and more well known bagel places in the area but Family Bagels are nice people, small shop and incredibly friendly.
229442-0003	While other may be ok waiting in line at Town Bagel we are happy with the quality and service we get at Family Bagels
229480-0001	you'll love it
229480-0002	I have had my back fused in 2 places.
229480-0003	I wish that I hadn't done this.
229480-0004	With these fusions, chiropractric isn't as successful, but it still is very helpful.
229480-0005	Even after my fusions, my back continued to hurt, but now it doesn't hurt any more.
229480-0006	I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery, to talk about different treatment options first with Dr. de Barros.
229480-0007	He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly.
229480-0008	You can see different treatments that a surgeon can't see, so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do.
229623-0001	A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here.
229623-0002	While there wasn't too much available for their age (ball pit, bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there, so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there.
229623-0003	It's not the classiest place, but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly.
229623-0004	For $4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler.
230176-0001	Excellent Physiotherapists!
230176-0002	Kusal Goonewardena and his team of Physios are unbelievable!
230176-0003	I have been suffering from back pain for over 12 years and have been to numerous specialists, physios, osteos and chiros with no help.
230176-0004	It took the Vigor team only 4 visits to get me feeling normal!
230176-0005	And now 2 months after my last appointment I am better than ever.
230176-0006	Thanks guys!
231203-0001	Okay, here's the scoop.
231203-0002	I'ma regular at the HH.
231203-0003	The food is excellent, the serivce is horrible.
231203-0004	I think they're still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking... not in any hurry.
231203-0005	In my experience the food has been excellent (for the most part).
231203-0006	However, the bartenders/waitresses definately need to be re-trained (if they ever had any to begin with) and learn two things: only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting.
231203-0007	In some cases the result is because of understaffing, in some cases the staff just doesn't care/know better.
231203-0008	They must also get something to keep take-out warm, so it's not room temperature at best when you get it home.
231203-0009	You just have to know what you're getting into when you go.
231203-0010	Nice local pub, excellent food (especially wings), and don't go if you have a limited amount of time.
231724-0001	Rooms were outdated, dirty, and small.
231724-0002	Service was horrible.
231724-0003	Go down 1 block to Super 8.
232106-0001	Clean & tidy with good atmosphere & pleasant staff.
232106-0002	Food drastically let's the place down though
232157-0001	Wonderful service for large group
232157-0002	I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant, and it was one of the best choices that I made.
232157-0003	It was a great deal--we paid a certain amount per person, and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted.
232157-0004	We were also served salad and soda.
232157-0005	We had a large party, about fifty people or so, and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time.
232157-0006	Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza, when guests asked for a different type, it was brought out with no charge to us!
232157-0007	I really appreciate BJs for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service.
232278-0001	You are the only one auto glass repair shop in the area I would count on.
234261-0001	Dr. Mann killed our pet
234261-0002	Yea, Dr. Mann ain't so great.
234261-0003	We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead.
234261-0004	We live in the sub-division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr. Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead.
234261-0005	If you take him here for shots, no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again.
234261-0006	Oh, they also charged me for the procedure ($250) AND had the audacity to charge me a $25 'DISPOSAL' fee.
234261-0007	They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee.
234261-0008	AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
235190-0001	Channel Guide
235190-0002	Believe it or not, but the channel guide has been most helpful to my family members that visit and don't know where to start when it comes to watching satellite tv.
235190-0003	I just give them guide and they can find anything they need.
235190-0004	Thanks again, Directv.
235211-0001	Lovely People, Great Hats
235211-0002	I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service.
235211-0003	It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly-accented English.
235211-0004	The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people.
235211-0005	We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act.
235211-0006	I recommend them highly!
235423-0001	The Worst Chinese I've Ever Had
235423-0002	This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had.
235423-0003	The service stunk.
235423-0004	I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up, they got my order confused with someone elses.
235423-0005	They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again.
235423-0006	They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $10 more than what she had wanted.
235423-0007	She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead.
235423-0008	We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order.
235423-0009	Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull.
235423-0010	They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up.
235423-0011	We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible.
235423-0012	I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken, sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that.
235423-0013	The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable.
235423-0014	I will NEVER go here again.
235423-0015	Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal.
235423-0016	I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote.
235462-0001	Hobbs on Mass.
235462-0002	Absolutely my favorite store in Lawrence, KS
235576-0001	The Best Breakfast in Solana Beach!
235576-0002	We love T's Cafe!
235576-0003	Without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some eggs benedict.
235576-0004	T's has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason.
235576-0005	Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home-cooked with style.
235576-0006	I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best.
235576-0007	If you've been to North County, chances are it's in your favorites list already.
236648-0001	Quick and Cheap
236648-0002	Walked in and was outta there in 10 mins with a really good deal i thought i was going to be paying alot because i had a DUI but with my DUI and Sr-22 they were able to get me the best deal out there.
238839-0001	This place is bad.
238839-0002	It's dark, dingy & dirty.
238839-0003	The salads are limp and the rest of the food isn't any better (ok, the nachos are not too bad!)
238839-0004	This place may have been something sometime; but it way past it "sell by date".
238839-0005	I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and cannot recommend it.
239035-0001	Le petit is the best place to get your nails done!
239035-0002	It is very clean, staff is friendly, and I have never waited!
239035-0003	I go every other week for the shallac/gel manicure which is only $25 and it truly lasts 2 weeks!
239035-0004	I love it.
239035-0005	Pedicures are also great.
239035-0006	Try this place out!
239035-0007	I promise you will not be disappointed!
240287-0001	Excellent Service and Reasonable Prices
240287-0002	Boutique stores dealing in children's clothing/gifts are often outrageously priced (who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie?)
240287-0003	but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose's prices are reasonable (for the SAME products found at other area boutiques, the prices were 20-25% cheaper).
240287-0004	The service was also excellent - friendly, helpful and informative without being overbearing.
240287-0005	Will definitely return.
241108-0001	STAY AWAY
241108-0002	Horrible service.
241108-0003	Absolutely rude.
241108-0004	Did services I asked them NOTto do and was still charged.
241739-0001	Great Barber
241739-0002	Firstly, the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick's, or he would know that Nick only charges $13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard.
241739-0003	I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail.
241739-0004	I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right.
241739-0005	Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par, but if you wait for Nick... you'll be good.
241855-0001	Home made product
241855-0002	I sometimes go into this store just for something to do on a sunday afternoon.
241855-0003	I love the people, the product and the service!
241855-0004	Nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time. -
241855-0005	The Brick, Ikea, and Leon's have their place.
241855-0006	But furniture like this will truly be around forever.
242303-0001	Awesome bacon egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast.
243369-0001	You are the best!
243369-0002	Just received from your flower store.
243369-0003	They are sooooo beautiful.
243369-0004	Thank you guys.
243799-0001	Rude Rude Rude
243799-0002	went in there and got my dog groomed came home to an uneven dog then took him back to get evened up what a mistake!
243799-0003	she didnt even let me finish a sentence without insulting me and telling me how i should have said it!
243799-0004	i wont go back!
243799-0005	she needs to develop a personality !
243799-0006	brought dog home and its all choppy now!
245160-0001	very professional / very helpful
245160-0002	the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful.
245160-0003	i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs.
245160-0004	they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale.
245160-0005	my experience with them was great - low stress, very helpful and very personal.
245160-0006	after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible.
245160-0007	from start to finish they were top notch.
245160-0008	i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car.
245928-0001	Rude and Untrustworthy
245928-0002	These guys took Customer Service 101 from a Neanderthal.
245928-0003	They are especially rude to women.
245928-0004	Do not trust them!
247097-0001	Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture Doctor
247097-0002	I am a college student.
247097-0003	Before treatment, my food cravings were "out of control" which caused me to be stressed out.
247097-0004	I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving (about 50%) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment.
247097-0005	I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment.
247097-0006	I was amazed.
247097-0007	I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99% gone after only 3 treatments.
247097-0008	Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend's aunt recommended it.
247097-0009	It hurt very little, felt more like pressure than pain.
247097-0010	What I like most about Dr. Liau is that she is very caring.
247097-0011	She talks to you at each appointment.
247097-0012	I can tell she really cares and wants to help.
247097-0013	I am SO GLAD to have found Dr. Liau.
247097-0014	Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer.
247226-0001	College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE!
247226-0002	Went to the school here OVER PRICED!!!!!!
247226-0003	You do NOT learn the things you were promised.
247226-0004	You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate!
247226-0005	Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont.
247226-0006	Staff is under educated.
247226-0007	Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money.
247226-0008	Over priced for students to learn!
247226-0009	Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon!!!
247226-0010	BEWARE!
248027-0001	Tried Crust on Broad on 3 occasions.
248027-0002	Twice for dinner and once for lunch Absolutely rude service every time!
248027-0003	The staff will not even answer the phone for take out.
248027-0004	Tonight, I called several times with no answer (Btwn 5:30 and 6 pm) and finally drove there to place my order in person.
248027-0005	There was not a customer to be found.
248124-0001	Pure Pilates!!
248124-0002	It is the real thing - I have been practicing Pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else.
248124-0003	It is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at TomiPilates that sets this studio apart from the others.
248124-0004	The teachers are highly trained and are expert at handling all types of clients.
248616-0001	Took a laptop in for a video cable to be replaced.
248616-0002	Everything except the display worked fine before I took it in.
248616-0003	The video cable was replaced and suddenly the motherboard was dead.
248616-0004	Phone calls weren't returned when promised and the botched repair took a week longer than promised.
249123-0001	No Customer Service
249123-0002	Employees seemed to be having a good time chatting and laughing with each other, while myself and other customers were completely ignored.
249123-0003	Another person in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales persons attention.
249123-0004	It wasn't until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked Can I help you.
249889-0001	great garage and customer service.
249889-0002	great knowledge and prices compared to anyone in the industry.
250878-0001	This is my favorite coffee store.
250878-0002	Just ask American Express
251475-0001	Great People and even better service!
251475-0002	Best to deal with!
251475-0003	In a few words ... I'm pleasantly surprised that you can still find "old school" service out there where company care more about good name and customers than their pockets...
251475-0004	Highly recommended people / business.
251475-0005	Thanks Josh!
251755-0001	Absolutely amazing job!
251755-0002	Susanna is the best dress maker/tailor I've ever come across in my whole life!
251755-0003	She makes every item fit you perfectly.
251755-0004	She is always so busy, too, which is a good indication of her talent.
251755-0005	She's the best!
251774-0001	Thank you for helping me get more healthy!
251774-0002	I came in and saw Dr. Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking.
251774-0003	I have to tell you that I haven't had one and don't want one.
251774-0004	It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too.
251774-0005	I sent a customer of mine to you.
251774-0006	Dr. Ruona, if you read this, thank you for helping me get more healthy.
251774-0007	I feel lighter and feel that I have more possibilities open to me now than I did before.
251774-0008	I can't thank you enough.
252791-0001	no feathers in stock!!!!
252791-0002	I was very upset when I went to Mother Plucker, they had NO FEATHERS and the quality is TERRIBLE.
252791-0003	I had to dig in a bag to find one nice feather, what a joke!
253807-0001	Cheapest drinks in Keene!
254908-0001	I hired this company to unlock my car.
254908-0002	The price they gave was good so I said hey this seems great.
254908-0003	After they showed up there was a little trouble to get my car unlocked, it took quite a bit of time but the job was well done.
255261-0001	Rate a church?
255261-0002	Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light.
255261-0003	It's a bloody church, for chrisssake!
255261-0004	Big, grey and imposing.
255261-0005	Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure.
255261-0006	The pastor at this church is cool, I met him after some holiday service.
255261-0007	He had a robe that was made back in the '60s.
255261-0008	God was pleased with that one!
255261-0009	It's historical for Sf, so when your aunte comes for a visit, take her there.
255261-0010	Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth (don't forget to tell 'em its really a 'pagen' thing!).
255261-0011	Stop by at least once or you'll go to heck!
255736-0001	Remember seeing "Stop Making Sense" at Cinema 21 multiple times!
255736-0002	YAY, great theater!!!
255757-0001	they recovered the pics geeksquad deleted.
255757-0002	many thanks
256677-0001	Love Hop City
256677-0002	This place is great!
256677-0003	Craig and Nate are wonderful.
256677-0004	I know now where to get all of my wine and beer.
256677-0005	No need to go to a grocer again.
257296-0001	Course has come a long way!!
257296-0002	HCC's new nine was a little shaky at first, but the NEW grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course!!
257296-0003	The comment below definitely needs to be retracted!
257296-0004	Come back and give HCC a second chance at least!
257296-0005	It is a great course for local golfers to be proud of and all the comments in 2008 have been very positive!!
257735-0001	Don't waste your money on the jukebox
257735-0002	The bartender is a douchebag and he has a little console behind the bar where he can delete songs he doesn't like, and you end up paying for it.
257735-0003	Not enough seating.
258042-0001	Lovley food and fab chips
260640-0001	I wouldn't send my dogs there.
260640-0002	I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010.
260640-0003	She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren't paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets.
260640-0004	Wow, really?
260640-0005	With all the child predators out there, a busy road, cars speeding by...... and you are going to let some 4/5 year olds wonder around cause you're money hungry?
260640-0006	REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
260640-0007	Whether they pay me or not, if their parents get into an accident, stuck in traffic, etc. THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN'T PAID.
262422-0001	Good local bikeshop
262422-0002	Good local bike shop .
262422-0003	Jason and the boys can do about anything you need.
262422-0004	The shop is located just off the river road .
262441-0001	I phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end(as our building contractor carried out the electrical work), they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using PJC as our electrical maintenance contractor.
262441-0002	Thoroughly recommended
262722-0001	recommended
262722-0002	Excellent location.

262722-0008	Choose this hotel over the Hilton (which is on the next block).
263630-0001	Orr's a nightmare!
263630-0002	DON'T GO!
263630-0003	My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who'd arrived around 1:00 am and were drinking at the springs.
263630-0004	When we complained to the management (as we were instructed to do if there were any problems), nothing happened!
263630-0005	Then, the next morning, when we, among many other irate guests, asked to speak to the owner, he refused to do so.
263630-0006	Not only that, but he told us, via his manager, that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued, even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids.
263630-0007	Orr is not relaxing, it's not a safe space, and the owner is awful.
263630-0008	To add insult to injury, he refused to refund our money.
263630-0009	Don't go!
263830-0001	Nice teachers good school
263830-0002	They are very good teachers and nice people to meet here.
263830-0003	I enjoyed very much to study here.
263830-0004	A good place to improve your English
263870-0001	Believe me.
263870-0002	This is THE premier university in Virginia.
263870-0003	It is also the largest.
263870-0004	With a Pizza Hut, IHOP, 3 Starbucks, Chilis, Panera, and Chipotle on campus ALONE, VCU has some of the best eating options for students.
263870-0005	VCU has the #1 art school in America, and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling.
263870-0006	The Rams, the VCU sports team, also made the NCAA Final 4 this year, too!
263870-0007	VCU also offers high-rise living for students and professors, and the historic yet fixed-up houses in the Fan are also available to students, professors, or even people wanting to live in a safe, viable community.
263870-0008	VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond, Canal Walk, Carytown, Stony Point, Short Pump, and the VCU Medical Center.
263870-0009	It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year.
263870-0010	The U of R is also recommended, too!
263909-0001	Great Service Great People
263909-0002	Bisconti wanted over $300 to fix my laptop and these guys fixed it for $90!
263909-0003	Call them today!
263909-0004	Had it fixed within a few days (had to order a part).
264993-0001	An Hour Of Prego Bliss!
264993-0002	I schedule my weekly appointment here just to get a chance to lie comfortably on my tummy.
264993-0003	And the massages are heavenly!
264993-0004	Very friendly place.
266591-0001	Best Chineese food in the area
266591-0002	The food here is fresh and hot out of the Wok.
266591-0003	The food is cooked fast by the two chefs on duty.
266591-0004	The lunch specials are more food than most people can eat for about $6.
266591-0005	It is busy every day at lunch for a reason, the service is fast and the food is great.
266676-0001	Thanks For A Great Job
266676-0002	Thanks For The Prompt Service And Great Job You And Your Boys Have Done On Our New Solar System, The Panels On The Roof Look Great And The Power We Are Putting Back In To The Grid Is Great, Great Job Thanks
266955-0001	The finest German bedding and linens store.
266955-0002	Quality and service come first here.
267732-0001	So very delicious!
267732-0002	Excellent!
267732-0003	November 7, 2010 First time eating at Caffe Bella Italia and it was a wonderful experience.
267732-0004	From the delectable Antipasto Misto to the Spaghetti alla Barese and the Parmigiana and ending with gelato, all was mouth watering.
267732-0005	Too bad they were out of the Chocolate Lava Cake.
267732-0006	Maybe next time they will have it.
267732-0007	Service was excellent!
267732-0008	Sandy
267793-0001	Great Doc
267793-0002	Dr Greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor.
267793-0003	He didnt prescribe pain meds or other drugs, he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable.
267793-0004	My neck is fixed!.
267793-0005	He knows what hes doing.
267982-0001	I won a golf lesson certificate with Adz through a charity auction.
267982-0002	The lesson was donated by the teacher Adz.
267982-0003	So i booked the lesson and loved it.
267982-0004	Great teacher.
268673-0001	tricky short guy
268673-0002	The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement.
268673-0003	To my surprise $20 deposit.... New movies not on shelf..under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only... or people who spend $30 or more groceries..
268673-0004	That did it for me..no more Raina's.
268673-0005	Besides parking is a pain..cramped and un-ruly with Kumon Parents next door....gives me heebee gee bees'
268952-0001	Wonderful Atmosphere
268952-0002	I have been going there since I was a little girl and love the friendly and relaxing atmosphere.
268952-0003	Dr. Stiefvater has always been very professional and helpful.
268952-0004	I would recommend Bayside Chiropractic to anyone who is in need of a regular adjustment or is suffering from a chronic condition.
269560-0001	Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker.
269560-0002	He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying, "you do not order what you do not know about" and "you don't know how pizza is made".
269560-0003	It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old.
269560-0004	He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home, the pie was the worst I have ever seen.
269560-0005	Cheese was falling off, so oily and greasy.
269560-0006	I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn't so well-done (actually, burnt).
269560-0007	I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $25.
269560-0008	THIS STORY IS 100% TRUE.
269560-0009	That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my *ss.
270502-0001	Great staff.
270502-0002	Very helpful!!!!
270502-0003	They interviewed me, gave me tests in the software I included on my resume, and placed me in a position that I kept for several years.
270502-0004	Re-interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job.
270502-0005	I'm really thankful for the folks at HR Office.
270502-0006	They are dependable, have great connections in the community, and are a great resource for finding a job.
270502-0007	I highly recommend them to all of my friends!!!!!
270889-0001	Staten Island Computers
270889-0002	Superior work - always comes through when we need him.
270889-0003	We have tried many different computer people until now - we will stick with Qualitech Computers!!!
272836-0001	So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential Numbers
272836-0002	Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village, I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers.
272836-0003	The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook.
272836-0004	It's really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word.
272836-0005	THX:-)
274106-0001	AMAZINGLY YUMMY!
274106-0002	I just got back from france yesterday and just missed the food already!
274106-0003	My sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town, I was so excited I just wanted to go and test it out for my self!
274106-0004	Their customer service was perfect!
274106-0005	Their Food was better then anything I had ever tasted.
274106-0006	EVEN IN FRANCE!

274498-0001	Learn from a Cesar Gracie black belt and former ufc fighter!

274498-0003	Best jiu-jitsu mma in Santa Rosa and i have the experience and belt to back it up!
274498-0004	When you come to ncfa you will see a real instructor that teaches and trains everyday!

274498-0006	Dave Terrell www.norcalfightingalliance.com
275140-0001	I'm really surprised by the negative reviews.
275140-0002	We've had about 5 repairs done on 3 different laptops.
275140-0003	They've always been timely and inexpensive.
275595-0001	teeth
275595-0002	this dentist want to pull the tooth out always.. always wants to do the cheapest for his benefit.. not unless he knows you.
275595-0003	and hopefully you do not know the same people because he tells others about you payment status.
275595-0004	Which should be a private issue
275919-0001	Grocery and Daily Needs Store
275919-0002	Before using FusionRetail Before installing FusionRetail store was running on a dos based software.
275919-0003	We were having a major problem in maintaining cash.
275919-0004	Being a grocery shop, maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job.
275919-0005	Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time.
275919-0006	How FusionRetail has overcome these issues ?
275919-0007	FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way.
275919-0008	Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale, purchase and returns was never easy before.
275919-0009	How long does it take to train new people at work ?
275919-0010	Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day's training How fast your support queries get answered ?
275919-0011	Over telephone, immediate.
275919-0012	On call, it takes a day to get our issues resolved.
276689-0001	The landlord is not nice nor helpful
276689-0002	I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years.
276689-0003	I love the location and the apartment!!
276689-0004	I'ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night.
276689-0005	The maintenance people are AWESOME!!!!
276689-0006	And the exterminator is very nice, also.
276689-0007	Yes, you still have a few bugs, but that's going to be anywhere you go!
276689-0008	The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord.
276689-0009	She is a pure b****!!!
276689-0010	I know that's ugly...but she won't help you out for anything...sad story.
276689-0011	Other than that, I would recommend living here. :)
277703-0001	The best Supermarket in Bay Ridge have everything what a customer needs.
278775-0001	Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company, thus we are certainly a niche market.
278775-0002	We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart, and Ulistic.
278775-0003	We made the decision for a couple of reasons.
278775-0004	1. Social Media.
278775-0005	We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies, but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing.
278775-0006	2. We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators.
278775-0007	How has it gone so far?
278775-0008	Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months, and have 100 people following our site on Facebook, and our web site, www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic, which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional.
278775-0009	We are absolutely confident that Stuart's ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow, and our business will reap the rewards of this program.
278775-0010	Finally, it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with, because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator.
279070-0001	Great Meal
279070-0002	Happened on to this place while out of town on business, and it was great!
279070-0003	The food was excellent and the service was terrific.
279070-0004	It is a cloth napkin kind of place, but I thought well worth it.
279437-0001	Excellent service, close to the morse redline stop.
279437-0002	Great computer repair store, highly recommended.
280170-0001	Can't say enough
280170-0002	I used to tan down the street before I was referred to this place by one of my friends.
280170-0003	WOW!
280170-0004	I didn't know what I was missing.
280170-0005	The lowest bed here is better than my last salons highest level.
280170-0006	Salon is clean and girls are nice.
280340-0001	My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we didn't want to wait in line at Outback.
280340-0002	What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM.
280340-0003	#1 its immaculately clean.
280340-0004	#2 the decor is tasteful and artistic, from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures.... and (most importantly) #3 the food is FANTASTIC.
280340-0005	This is authentic Cuban cuisine; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly.
280340-0006	The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant.
280340-0007	TRY THIS PLACE - YOU'LL LOVE IT.
280663-0001	Best DJ's In Town!
280663-0002	Wow!
280663-0003	These guys were the best.
280663-0004	They were thorough, high class, and went above and beyond.
280663-0005	We never had to worry about a thing, and they led the way the whole time.
280663-0006	They asked us things that we would have never have thought of, and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding.
280663-0007	Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time!
280663-0008	They may look young but don't let that fool you, as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected.
280663-0009	I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80's, and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960's.
280663-0010	So we didn't expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night.
280663-0011	They just really know their stuff!
280844-0001	Good Service - Limited Results
280844-0002	Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re: infertility.
280844-0003	He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action.
280844-0004	The office is shared with a foot doctor and it's very sterile and medical feeling, which I liked.
280844-0005	The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients/doctors.
280844-0006	I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs.
280844-0007	The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles.
280844-0008	I know it can take awhile for results and didn't expect a miracle, but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost/time.
280844-0009	(I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews...)
281976-0001	do NOT bring your car here
281976-0002	I got a coupon from Pennysaver for this station.
281976-0003	Yes, they accepted it.
281976-0004	However, during the test, they did whatever they can to get my test failed.
281976-0005	Then, they sold me overpriced stuffs, such as oil tank cap, so that my car can pass it right away.
281976-0006	I ended up paying much more.
283041-0001	Great Cookies, Cakes, and Customer Service
283041-0002	It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-made in a convenience store, but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake, Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake.
283041-0003	Not only did it taste wonderful, but the texture was unbelievable, the frosting wasn't overly sweet to over power the cake, and the cake itself was just amazingly soft, and fluffy, and just perfect overall.
283041-0004	Although I'll have to drive a little out of my way to go there, I'll gladly do it knowing that since she's been astounding to me once before that she'll always be that way!
283041-0005	(Also she has a really great website!
283041-0006	And we bought a few cookies there too, they were fantastic as well!)
283041-0007	She deserves many 5 star reviews!!
283903-0001	very reasonable prices.
283903-0002	quick in & out.
283903-0003	Friendly service.

287360-0001	So delightful.
287360-0002	What a group!
287360-0003	I wouldn't want any other company in my time of need.
287360-0004	Great people!

287360-0006	These guys know what they're doing!
287360-0007	Way to go!
287454-0001	This is not your usual cheap hotdog place.
287454-0002	They offer a large variety of quality hotdogs and hamburgers They also offer veggie dogs.
287454-0003	The fries are of good quality, the staff is friendly.
287454-0004	The atmosphere is your typical indie outfit with old movie posters and memorabilia from the 70's and 80's.
287501-0001	Kliotech
287501-0002	A company which provide good quality portals, E-commerce solutions,web based MMOG ... etc
288100-0001	Poor Service, Lack of Passion: Do NOT go
288100-0002	I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care, patient-doctor communication, and just the overall level of services.
288100-0003	The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office.
288100-0004	It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task, and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion (not that it's a requirement for the job, but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful).
288100-0005	Also, I was promised to have my test results emailed to me, but it never happened, and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition, I finally gave up and went to a different doctor.
288100-0006	Please do not go there if it's professional, friendly, diligent medical services you're looking for.
288100-0007	Save yourself the trouble, money and time and visit a more caring facility/doctor.
288163-0001	Amazing Experience!
288163-0002	My experience was amazing at Providence Aesthetics and Medical Spa.
288163-0003	Jana Kueck was nothing but professional.
288163-0004	She makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world.
288163-0005	Jana made me feel very comfortable.
288163-0006	Provided me with warm blanket and has soft music playing.
288163-0007	Walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed.
288163-0008	Equipment is state of the art.
288163-0009	I would reccomend anyone to go see Jana Kueck and Robin Talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer.
288894-0001	Wrong Information
288894-0002	The address is for Noida Location not for Gurgaon Location.
288894-0003	Please update this listing in you database.
288930-0001	great! :P
288930-0002	you get a really good view of the city and there is also attractions like simulator, short movies.
288930-0003	Try the 360 restraunt u spin in the cn tower with a beautiful view the sky pod elevator is about an hour line up in the summer
289763-0001	Awesome service with a smile :)
290238-0001	Out of business?
290238-0002	I think this location is no longer in business.
290238-0003	If you check RecWarehouse.com, they don't list this as a location.
290238-0004	You'll have to drive 10 miles down 75 to Allen.
290594-0001	What you can learn from the below 'bad experience'.
290594-0002	I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the 'bad experience' review.
290594-0003	I'd probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here, seeing that they don't just take every dog coming in.
290594-0004	I've toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was, and all the options for the dogs.
290594-0005	It's unfortunate that bmil believed that his 'perfect' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself.
290594-0006	But I've done hundreds of dog introductions myself (another place, I don't work here), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs.
290594-0007	Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively; and it's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem.
290594-0008	It sounds (according to your own statement) that they had a roomful of dogs, so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems.
290594-0009	You say you work a lot, and that you have a young dog; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him.
290594-0010	But not at a risk to other people's pets.
290594-0011	You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home, to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times, getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later.
290594-0012	No business is going to push customers away without good reason; so isn't it reasonable to think they might know what they're doing?
290594-0013	My dogs are far from perfect, and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself (at least initially).
290594-0014	Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this; and maybe don't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don't want to work hard, just because you bruised your own ego.
291046-0001	Hams on Friendly ... RIP
291046-0002	This is the original Ham's restaurant, expanded into a regional chain in the late 80's -- but this one is no more.
291046-0003	Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management.
291046-0004	According to news accounts, the company is struggling.
291046-0005	I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago.
291046-0006	So long Hams ... you will be missed.
291088-0001	I am a new patient.
291088-0002	I have visited Dr. Cooper's office twice and I am very impressed with how friendly and polite the staff is.
291088-0003	I found the office to be very clean and professional-looking.
292841-0001	Absolutely the best little motel on the coast!
292841-0002	I've stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running, and I have to say it's one of the best lodging experiences I've ever had on the coast...and I'm even comparing it to the big resorts I've stayed at!
292841-0003	A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend, and the experience and stay have always been five-star.
292841-0004	The rooms are SO clean, the managers/owners are the nicest people, the place feels so homey, and the location and grounds are beautiful.
292841-0005	There's a restaurant nearby (walking distance) with a great breakfast, and a market across the street.
292841-0006	The motel is very well maintained, and the managers are so accomodating, it's kind of like visiting family each year! ;-)
292841-0007	I honestly can't rave enough about this place...it's really a hidden gem worth checking out!
292997-0001	Alto delivers on all levels.
292997-0002	From the moment you enter the restaurant, you know you are some place special.
292997-0003	The service is impeccable, and the food is even better.
292997-0004	I highly recommend the four-course tasting menu, which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite.
292997-0005	Also, if you are into wine, Alto has the depth of both region, varietal, and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier (or after 9pm, bring your own bottle for free...no corking fee!).
292997-0006	While it's not cheap, Alto will give you an experience you'll never forget.
294081-0001	DINING AT TEXAS ROADHOUSE
294081-0002	TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS, THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES.
294081-0003	IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES.
294081-0004	ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS.
294081-0005	ALSO, THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR.
294081-0006	NEXT, THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD.
294081-0007	ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT.
294081-0008	I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW.
294081-0009	I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS.
294081-0010	WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY,THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE.
294081-0011	I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH, 2009.
294081-0012	I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008, WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT.
294081-0013	THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS, HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
294081-0014	IN MY OPINION SHOULD OF JUST TOOK OFF THE PRICE OF THE WINGS FROM THE BILL.
294081-0015	BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY!!!!!!
294812-0001	It's now called Sushi Lover.
294812-0002	Food is just okay..won't crave it, but wouldn't mind coming back for a quick meal.
294978-0001	not impressive enough
294978-0002	It's a fine place, I'm just a little mystified about the Michelin star.
294978-0003	Nothing wrong with it, just better options at this price point.
295288-0001	Just Autos Thank you!
295288-0002	Was fast and easy, Just had our car returned this morning, I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure.
295288-0003	They certainly know what they are doing.
295288-0004	The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems, he explained the problem and was very up front and honest, it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working (he explained it better).
295288-0005	They phoned the same day, confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job, I gave the go ahead.
295288-0006	Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well... ever its like driving a new car.
295288-0007	So yes, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs,Thank you Just Autos for your help.
295491-0001	Skip te rest - this is the best
295491-0002	Absolutely great !
295491-0003	Clean, updated room, friendly staff, safe location.
295491-0004	Staff is super friendly, treat you as a friend.
295491-0005	Cannot ask for a better experience.
295491-0006	Will be staying here any and every time I come anywhere near.
295491-0007	Overall, Joe is a happy camper who has found a great spot.
295727-0001	Skylight repair
295727-0002	My skylight was making a horrible noise when the wind blew.
295727-0003	James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently.
295727-0004	He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention.
295727-0005	He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction.
295727-0006	When the next hailstorm blows through, I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction.
295935-0001	Very Informative website with alot of good work
296357-0001	Close to my house, this is the only reason I would go to this particular QT.
296406-0001	Horrible tap water.
296406-0002	But no other complaints.
299148-0001	Outdated but not bad
299148-0002	So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern.
299148-0003	It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels.
299148-0004	The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together.
299148-0005	If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don't let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else.
299169-0001	Terrible customer service
299169-0002	Fried rice has NO flavor, it literally taste like water.
299169-0003	When I tried to return it they refused, so I had to leave without a refund and still hungry.
299524-0001	Quality has fallen over the years, but still the best go-to burger place on the East Bay.
302465-0001	Great place
302465-0002	Really great service and kind staff.
302465-0003	The haircut was inexpensive and so were the salon services (eyebrows were cheap!).
302465-0004	It's a nice, relaxed place to get stuff done and relax.
302465-0005	I plan on going again.
303728-0001	Great gym and great services.
303922-0001	A+
303922-0002	Excellent customer service and honest feedback.
303922-0003	The team at Bradley Chevron kept my car running for well past its expected death!
303922-0004	They are honest about 'immediate' concerns versus 'recommended' repairs and have very fair prices.
303922-0005	Such a convenient location as well with coffee shop and bradley food and beverage right around corner.
304759-0001	A very nice park.
304759-0002	The architecture is simplz splendid.
305187-0001	Apps 4 Salad 3 Entree 3.5 Wine 5 (NOV 07)
305187-0002	Enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folks.
305187-0003	Service was excellent.
305187-0004	Food was excellent.
305187-0005	Wine was excellent.
305187-0006	I was feeling the need for some fish so I had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if I am in town again, I'll definitely order a steak.
305187-0007	A perfect place for a romantic dinner.
305187-0008	Lots of "pretty people" dining inside.
305681-0001	This is a great facility.
305681-0002	Great instructors!
305681-0003	Most of all, my daughter loves it!
306740-0001	Miami's best tutoring service!
306740-0002	My son was able to advance a full two grades within 9 months!
306740-0003	A wonderful tutoring service for students needing help with elementary - middle school work.
307170-0001	Best Limo Limousine service in all of Dallas
307170-0002	Great Limos company int he DFW fort Worth Metro area.
307170-0003	I use their limo services for all of my airport car services and airport transportation needs
307209-0001	LOCATION HAS CLOSED.
307209-0002	HAS MOVED TO 4783 Bay Rd Saginaw, Michigan 48604 (989)755-1109
307250-0001	$9.62 excluding tip with water to drink for the buffet.
307250-0002	Worst buffet period by far.
307250-0003	I want my money back!
308088-0001	Internet Department is rude and insulting
308088-0002	I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS.
308088-0003	I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS" Wow, can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles.
308088-0004	As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker.
308088-0005	Stay away from this dealership!!!
308297-0001	Great Place!
308297-0002	This is one of my favorite places to eat for lunch.
308297-0003	They offer a good portions at a great price, it's enough food to fill you up, but you don't ever feel like you ate too much.
308297-0004	Plus, it's super healthy!
308387-0001	I called them for an estimate and they INSULTED ME WHEN I ASK THEM QUESTIONS.
308387-0002	THEY ARE VERY RUDE AND NASTY.
308387-0003	PLEASE DON'T USE THIS MOVING COMPANY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO: CRY, HAVE TROUBLE AND A BAD EXPERIENCE ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE.
308387-0004	THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LOW PRICE OVER THE PHONE AND ON THE DAY OF YOUR MOVE THEY WILL CHANGE THE PRICE, I GUARANTEE IT.
309168-0001	love this park
309168-0002	this is a great park to have kids birthday parties at!!
309258-0001	slow service
309258-0002	I used to take my cars there all thetime, but management changes hands too frequently, the service has been slow, and they often try to "add on" extra services, which sometimes is not needed.
309258-0003	I dont go there anymore
310018-0001	Natasha is the BEST photographer we have ever worked with.
310018-0002	She has a great way with children and is able to capture their personality as well as many spontaneous images.
310018-0003	You will not be disappointed with her work!!
310032-0001	Gone downhill since change in ownership
310032-0002	Sigh.
310032-0003	I used to LOVE this place.
310032-0004	But now that they are part of a chain, service has slipped.
310032-0005	I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them, they lost my car key.
310032-0006	Lucky I had a spare with me!
310032-0007	To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one.
310032-0008	(These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy, you can't just go to WalMart.)
310032-0009	Go to the website for coupons and join the club -you can get free parking.
310032-0010	However, with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility, it may be cheaper to park at BNA.
311138-0001	Consistantly poor
311138-0002	A lack of organisation, coupled with the distain for its customers, makes this the worst rental agency I have used.
311138-0003	Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in (many of them still unresolved as I left) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds, after I left. . . . as soon as I could.
311138-0004	If you must use them, be vigilant and be ready to push, if you can go elsewhere then I would.
311987-0001	Not so great
311987-0002	My husband just got a bike there as a gift he's only had it a month.
311987-0003	It's a nice bike and it cost a lot of money.
311987-0004	But just this week a peddle broke.
311987-0005	He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes??
311987-0006	So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price.
311987-0007	Which was very expensive.
311987-0008	He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off??
311987-0009	Trek is not so great
313126-0001	I gave Dr. Rohatgi 2 stars because her assistant was very pleasant.
313126-0002	However, I did not find her very helpful and her receptionist was rude.
313558-0001	Dentist you can trust
313558-0002	If possible I try the services on myself before I bring in my son.
313558-0003	Drs. Ali work wonders.
313558-0004	Neither me nor my son haven't had a single cavity since we started dental care there.
313558-0005	The team focus is prevention and education.
313558-0006	That alone makes them unique.
313714-0001	Make You Feel Like a Number
313714-0002	Stay away from Kids First West Chester.
313714-0003	You NEVER get a human on the phone.
313714-0004	It's impossible to get an appointment.
313714-0005	If you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late they make you re-schedule... for 6 weeks later.
313714-0006	And worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient.
313714-0007	Go somewhere else.
313825-0001	Perfect Location plus
313825-0002	I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it's been a refreshing change.
313825-0003	I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare.
313825-0004	The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I'ma bit surprised by other comments.
313825-0005	She's very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests.
313825-0006	Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit.
314024-0001	Old time grocery, best steaks I have ever had!
314024-0002	Great meats that are already cooked, easy to take home for dinner.
314711-0001	Dr. White is the best!
314880-0001	I am in love with the giant plate of nachos!
314880-0002	Last time I went however, my beer was warm and the service was so-so.
314880-0003	I get that careless teenager kind of treatment from some of their staff...perhaps they should hire more serious adults to help serve/cook.
314938-0001	The best pilates on the Gold Coast!
314974-0001	My Favorite in McLean
314974-0002	My family loves coming to Endo Sushi.They are very nice, it is never crowded, and the food is wonderful, very delicious and fresh!
314974-0003	Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront, and it is on a one-way street, but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded.
314974-0004	If you cannot park in the lot, then you can park in the shopping center's garage, and walk up to Endo Sushi.
314974-0005	The service is fast.
314974-0006	Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal!
314974-0007	(it's by the door, on the hostess stand)
315763-0001	Love my home at Creekside
315763-0002	I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6-month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months!
315763-0003	The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff, esp. Edwin, are just wonderful.
315763-0004	They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help.
315763-0005	Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail, the location is surprisingly quiet.
315763-0006	I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety.
315763-0007	The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and other stores.
315763-0008	The well-equipped, clean gym is a plus!
315763-0009	Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose!
317326-0001	Midtown Reston has great location and luxurious environment.
317326-0002	Really enjoyed it.
317480-0001	Great atmosphere, great food.
317480-0002	Definitely a must.
317594-0001	Great Dude Cut!
317594-0002	Great service, cool vibe, impeccable style.
317594-0003	I'ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job #1.
317594-0004	After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda.
317594-0005	Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave...saying it's the best look I've ever had.
317594-0006	Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius.
317594-0007	Looks like there's a lot of talent in this place.
317594-0008	Worth every penny.
317846-0001	Great Sanwiches, Great Prices
317846-0002	I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches.
317846-0003	Chicken salad salad is great too.
317846-0004	Best of all, the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines, usually serve you in 5 minutes or less.
317846-0005	For the quality, the prices ($4-$6) have to be the best in town.
317846-0006	The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well.
317846-0007	Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality, but I certainly do.
317846-0008	This isn'ta TGIF or Cafe, its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that.
319816-0001	AWFUL SERVICE!
319816-0002	After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past, I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location.
319816-0003	I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire.
319816-0004	I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop (that is apparently what you are supposed to do, but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage, so you don't see them drving up, and they purposely block the front pull-up that all other Sear's use).
319816-0005	Once inside, I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before--FINALLY-- a technician got to me.
319816-0006	Once I returned to pick up my car, you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting.
319816-0007	I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn't possible.
319816-0008	Once I actually got back in my car, it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel.
319816-0009	OK, one bad experience...fine.
319816-0010	The following Friday, I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires, which were worn.
319816-0011	I would not have gone back, but I couldn't find the particular tire they'd used in stock anywhere else.
319816-0012	Once again, I waited for quite a bit before being attended to.
319816-0013	I got the order completed, and then questioned the technician since it came out about $40 less than I expected.
319816-0014	He said it was the same tire, and verified this, after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week.
319816-0015	However, when he printed out the service quote, I could see that it was NOT the correct tire, and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model.
319816-0016	So I pointed this out to him, at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock.
319816-0017	Ok--fine.
319816-0018	So I got just my other rear tire replaced.
319816-0019	They promised it'd be done within an hour, so I waited in the lobby.
319816-0020	Over two hours later (and ten minutes before they closed) my car was finally finished.
319816-0021	A few minutes after I left, I was called and informed that "I" left my wheel lock (which they should have left in the car).
319816-0022	Of course, they would be closing in 5 minutes, so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day.
319816-0023	Of course I couldn't make it back in time (and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me).
319816-0024	The next day, no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in.
319816-0025	Of course, they couldn't call him either to ask about it because apparently they don't keep their employees' phone numbers (riiight), so I would have to return on Monday (driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat).
319816-0026	On Monday I called and again it was a big to-do to find anyone who knew anything about it.
319816-0027	Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening, but I'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal.
319816-0028	The employees at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there didn't seem to be any sort of management that I could see.
319816-0029	I will never return there again (and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car).
322225-0001	Great Wine & Service
322225-0002	This place is so great!
322225-0003	They have a great selection of wine from all over the world with all different prices.
322225-0004	The employees make you feel very comfortable and are very helpful, whether you are very knowledgeable or don't know anything at all about wine.
322225-0005	Check out their wine tastings every Friday night!
323248-0001	Summary: Not cheep, but very fast, and super friendly service.
323248-0002	Quality of work is sufficient but not outstanding.
323248-0003	Like all oil place changes, ask/recommend the 100 other services they have.
323248-0004	Will be a repeat customer with discount coupons.
323449-0001	Finest??
323449-0002	Really??
323449-0003	I beg to differ.
323449-0004	This place is marginal at best.
323449-0005	Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained.
323449-0006	I was not impressed, and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses.
323449-0007	I understand not wanting to put labels like 5.10 on an indoor course, because yes, it is not the same, but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve.
323449-0008	I don't want to waste my time on routes set for children, but I don't want to take on something I can't handle just to strain myself to exhaustion.
323449-0009	Rate the routes, with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy, moderate, and hard.
323449-0010	Again, a great outing for the kids, a frustration for an out of town climber.
324337-0001	DONT ever go there, not even if your car flips.
324337-0002	Their service sucks to start off with, people are cruel and ignorant.
324337-0003	I'm compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products.
324337-0004	They DO NOT have a return policy and even if their product SUCKS, they will NOT take it back!
324337-0005	DO NOT EVER GO HERE.
324337-0006	I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people.
324337-0007	And they THRIVE to get a customer.
324337-0008	DO NOT go here..thank you
325292-0001	Food was cold
325292-0002	I have been here 3 to 4 times and every time food they served seems warmed up not cooked after you order it.
325292-0003	I like my food hot both ways not warm or cold.
325292-0004	Price and taste is good.
325292-0005	I will be happy if they can serve when food is piping hot.
325292-0006	KB
325330-0001	Not impressed.
325330-0002	Overpriced and the doctor acted arrogant and rushed at a time when there was very few clients in the facility.
325330-0003	I won't return.
325538-0001	Wonderful staff and great service !!
325741-0001	Class act.
325741-0002	It was late in the day and I was worried I would get charged an arm and a leg and have to wait forever.
325741-0003	They picked my car up in Yarmouth and towed to Bath for a great price.
325741-0004	Would do business with them again.
326112-0001	PAT testing quick & efficient
326112-0002	I rang SRD PAT testing and within 3 hours Scot had come to my premises and PAT tested all my our Spill The Whisky barn dance band equipment, and supplied a certificate for only 70p per unit.
326112-0003	Fantastic, quick and efficient service.
326112-0004	How rare!
326112-0005	Well done.
326439-0001	HEAVEN ON EARTHHHHHHH!!!!
326439-0002	MUST TRY!!!
326439-0003	A+++
326439-0004	THIS PLACE IS THE BEST.

326439-0009	I EAT HERE AT LEAST 5 DAYS A WEEK.
326439-0010	THEY HAVE EXCELLENT SUSHI CHEF SPECIAL ROLLS FOR A FAIR PRICE AND SO IS THE GRILL ORDERS.
326439-0011	A++++ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
326439-0012	JUNO AND OPEN I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
326439-0013	[no homo] :D
326649-0001	Trust The Midas Touch
326649-0002	I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles, I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else!
326649-0003	the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money.
326649-0004	This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner.
326649-0005	I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them!
326649-0006	Like the girl with the fuse problem...
326649-0007	Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical!
326649-0008	maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal.
326649-0009	I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town!
326649-0010	When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust!
327766-0001	Checked in real late, but staff was very kind and helpful.
327766-0002	Rooms very clean and smelled very fresh.
327766-0003	I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
327766-0004	I loved my stay here and if ever back in the area, I will be staying here again.
327867-0001	Good clean store nice car wash
328828-0001	Terrible service!!!
328828-0002	Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate.
328828-0003	They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate.
328828-0004	When I called the manager to complain, she said she KNEW the guy didn't know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier!
328828-0005	Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead.
328828-0006	So what was the point of the appointment!?!
328828-0007	To just come over and hang out?!?
328828-0008	I will NEVER do business with this company!
328828-0009	EVER!!!
329692-0001	Instructor never showed up!
329692-0002	January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday's 2 PM class "Beginning Yoga with Brittany."
329692-0003	We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests.
329692-0004	The instructor did not show up!
329692-0005	We waited until 2:25 PM and then left.
329692-0006	There were 2 in our group, and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class.
329692-0007	Well, not much I can say except I'm very disappointed with this experience.
329692-0008	This was our first visit to your studio.
329692-0009	In today's instant world, there's no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e-mail if she was going to be late.
329692-0010	As a yoga studio, I'm sure you're all aware that all actions generate karma …
329692-0011	and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google.
329807-0001	Best Electrician in Florence
329807-0002	I have been using Steele Electric for years.
329807-0003	They have always done a great job at a reasonable price.
329807-0004	Highly recommended.
329991-0001	I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17.
329991-0002	Mixed Tempura.....................8.25 Shrimp or vegetable tempura & salad.
329991-0003	I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size, to go box set up and quality of the food for the price.
329991-0004	I'm very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again.
330275-0001	Some of the nicest people and very good work standards
330966-0001	Room ok.
330966-0002	Service and Client base not ok.
330966-0003	I have stayed in this hotel many times, and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck, its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local, not so pleasant hood.
330966-0004	I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself, but when I had to listen to a (non-violent) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours, my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel, or just get over it.
330966-0005	I chose the later, but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities, not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get.
330966-0006	I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call.
330966-0007	I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel, but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers.
331662-0001	Nice selection, very clean, friendly staff!
331662-0002	Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family.
331662-0003	Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook.
331662-0004	The staff are very friendly and conscientious.
331662-0005	They always ask if you have meat in your dish, (for vegetarians like me), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook.
331662-0006	They don't just dump your ingredients on and cook either, but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush.
331662-0007	The selection of meats, veggies and sauces is awesome too!
331662-0008	Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting.
331662-0009	Meats are kept VERY cold, seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean.
331662-0010	Prices are reasonable, (Kids meals are around 4.99) and Wednesday's they have discount dinner prices, I believe.
332068-0001	Would not recommend I Was in a fair amount of pain for several weeks.
332068-0002	his clinic is very very dirty he is a real disaster to go totally not organized for every step he take .
332105-0001	My wife and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical re-wiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved.
332105-0002	I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable.
332105-0003	He was prompt, knowledgable, friendly, clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business.
332105-0004	I will reccommend his services however/whenever possible!
332476-0001	Amazing Pictures at an Amazing Price
332476-0002	Rendy is totally amazing.
332476-0003	She gave me amazing pictures at an amazing price and made my wedding day so memorable.
332476-0004	She was way easy to work with and made my wedding day so easy and she got some amazing pictures, not only of me, but of my family and friends.
332476-0005	She is amazing.
332476-0006	I would recommend her to anyone!
332785-0001	Thanks for following me around the store
332785-0002	Enough said.
332785-0003	I don't steal, I wasn't acting suspiciously.
332785-0004	I was ready to buy a new jacket, a new sweater and a couple of your overpriced belts and I walked out because of your obvious lurking
332972-0001	The best pizza ever im fat so ive had a ton of pizza other than pizza from chicago its the best
333243-0001	Very unhappy ...
333243-0002	Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA, so I did not know what to expect.
333243-0003	That said - he seemed to be doing well enough.
333243-0004	However, then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for.
333243-0005	I expected to pay for this service, but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared.
333243-0006	Asked why, Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment (it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary, one would think) and that took time to figure out.
333243-0007	Well, that was strike one.
333243-0008	I wasn't going to use them again, but I was going to leave it at that.
333243-0009	However, now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $6,000+ despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do, I feel I have to voice my opinion.
333243-0010	Last year, after all was said and done, I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no/little tax liability at the end of the year.
333243-0011	He said yes.
333243-0012	Well, again, I am now faced with a tax bill of $6,000+, all due on April 15, 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is 'well, you won't have to pay a penalty.'
333243-0013	I may not have to pay a penalty, yet, but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys.
333243-0014	In the words of my new accountant, THEY LET ME DOWN!
333628-0001	WHAT A GREAT DEAL THANK YOU
333672-0001	Best Car Dealer in TX
333672-0002	I purchased a nissan from this dealship.
333672-0003	The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at.
333672-0004	They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork.
333672-0005	The paperwork was a very easy and smooth.
333672-0006	They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it won't hurt my score.
333672-0007	Overall, I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase.
333672-0008	If you're looking to buy a car, definitely give them a call.
333672-0009	They have a huge inventory.
334388-0001	No way.
334388-0002	I'm certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong.
334388-0003	Cold, slimy, tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods.
334388-0004	Not good, not great, and again another disappointment in Central Iowa.
334388-0005	How do these places stay in business.
334388-0006	This town needs some food soul and this is not it.
334808-0001	Great deals, great pizza!
334928-0001	One of the better vegetarian sandwiches I've had in Seattle.
334928-0002	And from a place that specializes in high quality meat, too.
335225-0001	Best Salsa (hehehe)
335225-0002	After my trees were cleaned up, they gave me a jar of salsa.
335225-0003	The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had, and he was right.
335225-0004	No joke!
335225-0005	I hate to say check them out just for the salsa, but James, I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside, they are a very good company, I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close.
335225-0006	Very affordable (don't call it cheap) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work.
335225-0007	And the salsa, be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around, you will need them.....
335490-0001	Cleanest guesthouse i have been to
335490-0002	Stayed here for 2 nights.
335490-0003	The owner was very friendly and helpful.
335490-0004	The rooms were very clean and the breakfast was excellent.
335490-0005	Good location and off road parking made our stay very convenient.
335815-0001	Very poor customer service.
335815-0002	There are a couple decent people working there, but the rest are VERY dishonest, as well as rude, I have yet to hear the truth come out of their mouths.
336049-0001	Not what i expected!
336049-0002	We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes.. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way!
336049-0003	~It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table, once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table.
336049-0004	Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service... hmm There was no canape's or amuse to keep us occupied, once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention.
336049-0005	Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely.
336049-0006	On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it....
336049-0007	Wouldn't go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper.
336285-0001	What a Preschool!
336285-0002	If you want the best for your child, don't hesitate in visiting this wornderful school.
336285-0003	This is the very best in the Gables.
336305-0001	hard to forgive such an awful margarita and steep prices but the food can be good
337971-0001	Great graphic design work!
337971-0002	Fresh Design Studio helped jump-start my own business by providing affordable and effective marketing materials: logo, flyers, posters ad design, and more.
337971-0003	They have unbeatable price in town and deliver on time.
337971-0004	I enjoy working with this architectural and graphic design firm and will recommend to anyone.
338429-0001	Identity Theft
338429-0002	Myself and my fiance's identity was stolen from the office staff.
338429-0003	We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual.
338429-0004	Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us.
338429-0005	It was a black female that use to work in the office.
338429-0006	She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work.
338429-0007	The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it.
338429-0008	Thats how they were caught.
338429-0009	They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments.
338429-0010	The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers.
338429-0011	Nobody lived there.
338429-0012	A girl would show up, then a guy in a nice car would show up.
338429-0013	Short time later the guy would leave, then the girl.
338429-0014	My apartment was usually quiet.
338429-0015	I lived in one that did not face the parking lot.
338429-0016	Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper.
338429-0017	It sucked having an SUV.
338429-0018	If I found a spot, I couldnt fit in it.
338429-0019	Gates worked 30% of the time at best.
338429-0020	Bugs were a small problem, nothing too bad.
339176-0001	Great Prices, Great service!
339176-0002	I've been to this shop twice (once for an inspection and again for an oil change) and they truly live up to their name: Discount!
339176-0003	They have all kind of coupons available for car washes, oil changes, state inspection, etc.
339176-0004	The thing is, you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates!
339176-0005	There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you'd like.
339176-0006	The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers.
339176-0007	Top notch, all the way!
340848-0001	Top notch eats!
340848-0002	So here we are in Manson.
340848-0003	Manson?
340848-0004	Yes, Manson.
340848-0005	Right near Chelan.
340848-0006	Aka Nowheresville.
340848-0007	And this litttle gem of a 7-table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise.
340848-0008	A short but wide-ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street.
340848-0009	Fantastic food served without pretense, very reasonably priced wine selections.
340848-0010	A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting.
340891-0001	The food tasted like rat feces
341397-0001	these guys were fantastic!
341397-0002	they fixed my garage doors in literally less than an hour.
341397-0003	the guy came on time and didn't take any breaks, he went straight to work and finished the job efficiently and promptly!
341397-0004	i couldn't be more happier with the way my garage looks.
341397-0005	GREAT JOB GUYS!
341435-0001	Nice and quiet place with cosy living room just outside the city.
341750-0001	Not so good
341750-0002	Not worth the money.
341750-0003	Bland and over cooked.
341750-0004	I felt as if I was in an over priced Olive Garden.
341750-0005	I was hoping to have found a regular place to eat.
341750-0006	But not so.
342807-0001	Great, and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville.
342807-0002	I was born and raised in Toronto, which has a huge West Indian (Trinidadian, Jamaican, etc) population.
342807-0003	So huge in fact, that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references, and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria.
342807-0004	Anyway, I was practically raised on this stuff, and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine, Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette.
342807-0005	All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food, is add a whole lot of pepper.
342807-0006	Alot.
342811-0001	Friendly staff, but definitely some problems
342811-0002	May, 2009.
342811-0003	We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out-of-town wedding guests.
342811-0004	Got put into the wrong room the first night, and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1:00 am!
342811-0005	Next day got moved into another room, on the same floor with other wedding guests.
342811-0006	There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2, no linens for sofa bed.
342811-0007	In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested.
342811-0008	A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room.
342811-0009	They were sent to our second room and had been opened--the ribbon-wrapped present, and all 3 envelopes.
342811-0010	Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent, but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items.
342811-0011	A mid-afternoon "fire drill" was disruptive, putting everyone out of the hotel.
342811-0012	When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down.
342811-0013	The staff was friendly, especially the front desk female supervisor, and seemed to want to help, but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again.
343035-0001	Excellent piano lessons
343035-0002	I'm very happy with the piano lessons Mrs. Lynda Mcmanus taught me.
343035-0003	Now I'm able to play the piano pretty well.
343336-0001	Got to love this place.
343336-0002	Everyone is relaxed and having fun!!!
343813-0001	Bad Service
343813-0002	Definately won't be returning.
343813-0003	Travelled 40mins after calling to see if a product was in stock.
343813-0004	Told that they had plenty.
343813-0005	Get there and there was nothing.
343813-0006	Not impressed!!!
345182-0001	Do not use this company!
345182-0002	I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced.
345182-0003	I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off.
345182-0004	They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace.
345182-0005	I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30.00.
345182-0006	When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT!!
345182-0007	I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job.
345182-0008	I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back.
345182-0009	The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it!
345182-0010	She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it.
345182-0011	I explained I did not get what I paid for.
345182-0012	She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job.
345182-0013	She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece.
345182-0014	I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit.
345182-0015	With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS.
345182-0016	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
345182-0017	There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment!!!!!
345455-0001	First Time Ballerina
345455-0002	My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time.
345455-0003	I'ma soccer mom so I wasn't sure what I was looking for when it comes to dancewear.
345455-0004	The staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what I needed for my first time ballerina.
345455-0005	The service at Instep was great!!
345455-0006	I would recommend them to anyone!
346074-0001	Did a great job of removing my tree in Conyers.
346074-0002	Thanks Southland.
346563-0001	A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
346563-0002	I remain unhappy.
346563-0003	I still have noticeable scarring.
346563-0004	I still have surgically induced hair loss.
346563-0005	My results were just AWFUL.
346563-0006	My post-op treatment was TERRIBLE.
346563-0007	I wouldn't recommend this place last year, and I certainly wouldn't recommend them this year.
346627-0001	Fantastic Place to buy your next vehicle
346627-0002	We have never had a bad experience buying from Edmark.
346627-0003	This is car number 3 we've purchased through them.
346627-0004	We trust and appreciate Scott Larson and know that he will always take good care of us and listen to our needs!
346627-0005	Thank you again for great customer service!
346960-0001	Excellent customer service and quality work.
346960-0002	They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots-- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels.
346960-0003	That was 4 years ago.
346960-0004	I haven't been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it.
346960-0005	(I've been through at least 5 places already.)
346960-0006	If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week, I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again.
348247-0001	happy customer
348247-0002	Mr. Squeege is THE BEST.
348247-0003	Prompt, Clean Windows.
348247-0004	Affordable pricing.
348247-0005	Friendly responses.
348247-0006	How else can excellent be described for a business of this sort?
348247-0007	They have been my only "go-to" resource since we first did business together.
348247-0008	You will find the same to be true for you.
348369-0001	Awesome!!!!
348369-0002	Yes my G1 screen is back working.
348369-0003	They was about to Charge me $129...
348369-0004	But i paid $100.
348369-0005	they save me from having to deal with Tmobile...
348369-0006	Tmobile want to Send of my phone and i didn't want to go thru that...
348369-0007	3 Days For get that...
348369-0008	Great service.
348369-0009	I would recommend them to anyone..
349020-0001	I purchased a 2-year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership.
349020-0002	The night I drove back home, I found that the rear window has some leakage.
349020-0003	(You can hear the wind while driving on highway.
349020-0004	Very likely it needs a new window seal).
349020-0005	I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive.
349020-0006	(But this is a certified car from a dealer.)
349020-0007	So I brought the car back the second day.
349020-0008	They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $175 just to diagnose the problem!
349020-0009	Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing.
349020-0010	I walked away.
349020-0011	So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER.
349020-0012	STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE.
351058-0001	One of the worst places
351058-0002	This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from.
351058-0003	the food was horrible not cooked like it should be, they got the order wrong on a number of occasions, and once forgot about my order.
351058-0004	i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady (who claimed to be a manager) said my food was on the way, and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way.
351058-0005	i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold.
351058-0006	in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector, and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant.
351561-0001	Dumbest F'ers ever
351561-0002	I called dominos tonight, it rang forever, I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says, MAY I HELP YOU?
351561-0003	So I say: I'm at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square (built in 1926) do you deliver to the Warwick?
351561-0004	They say no, Warwick in New Jersey, Call New Jersey.
351561-0005	I laugh and say, no, that Warwick is in New York, but I'm at the Radison-Warwick.
351561-0006	And he says: You're at Warwick in Pennsylvania?
351561-0007	and I said, YES, CENTER CITY PHILLY, and he says, NO, Warwick is a township, If you're at a Radison in Warwick thats too far, try dominos in Pottstown.
351561-0008	I say, NO, I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square.
351561-0009	He says: I not know that town, I have to get to work, I'm in PHILLY.
351561-0010	Call dominos in your town.
351561-0011	I SAY LISTEN: I'm at 17th and LOCUST, do you deliver there?
351561-0012	He says, I have to have an exact ADDRESS.
351561-0013	OK, 1701 LOCUST STREET i say.
351561-0014	he says: Why you tell me your in WARWICK TOWNSHIP?
351561-0015	He gives the phone to a girl, she says, I have to have your address, I say, do you deliver to 17th and locust, she says, your exact address, I say 1-7-0-1 Locust, ARe you sure? she asks?
351561-0016	YES I am sure, well, she says, is that ON 17th STREET.
351561-0017	Yes, I say.
351561-0018	17th, like over by 16th and 15th YES, I say, one mile west of you.
351561-0019	You're at 7th.
351561-0020	I am just south of Walnut.
351561-0021	She says, Is that 17th like over past broad.
351561-0022	YES, I am west of broad.
351561-0023	Broad, I say, is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut.
351561-0024	Hmmm, she says, Then why are you calling here, we don't go past broad?
351561-0025	Anyway, after much yelling and cussing I hung up, grabbed a cab, and went to Geno's.
351727-0001	Overpriced
351727-0002	This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille, so I imagine they are owned/operated by the same people.
351727-0003	The food is mediocre at best, and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality.
351727-0004	Don't even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there.
351727-0005	I have ate here 3 times since they first opened, and the service has been poor each time, the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow.
351840-0001	Caldwell insurance has been doing our insurance for a couple years now and they have been extremely thorough.
351840-0002	We've only had one urgent issue to deal with and they were very prompt in their response.
351840-0003	Highly recommend!
351950-0001	local crew!!!
351950-0002	home team - thanks 4 playin!!!
352068-0001	Easy registration, helpful staff and fun teachers!
353684-0001	My favorite place to eat.
353684-0002	The Atmosphere is the best.. Italian music, candles, helpful and friendly staff... And the food is beautiful too !
353891-0001	Great Manicure
353891-0002	This place offers a great manicure and pedicure.
353891-0003	My nails looked great for the better part of 2 weeks!
353891-0004	Also very friendly and the stylists are not in the "been there/done that" mood!
354336-0001	Hidden Gem in Alpharetta
354336-0002	This French born, French trained chef and his creative partners offer a taste fresh, locally sourced, fabulously prepared food in the most unlikely of locations.
354336-0003	Try their weekend "tastings" which you can learn about by getting on their weekly email list.
354336-0004	It's the best meal for the money you will find in all of metro Atlanta.
354474-0001	Great work!
354474-0002	The people at Gulf Coast Siding were very easy and clear to work with.
354474-0003	They walked me through all the steps involved in the the installation project so that there were no surprises.
354474-0004	I found them extremely professional and would highly recommend them.
354474-0005	Thanks
354555-0001	the service is quick.
354555-0002	and the people are sweet :)
354860-0001	The best company in Phuket for creating website and e-commerce website.
354860-0002	From first meeting with them to launch of my website, everything went smooth and on schedule.
354860-0003	Highly recommended for who wants to have website.
354860-0004	Great with SEO as well.
355325-0001	My favorite florist!
355325-0002	I came to La Crosse to go to college, and my mom would send me birthday flowers though here.
355325-0003	They were beautiful and lasted forever!
355325-0004	Now that I live here, this is my favorite place to grab flowers for friends and coworkers!
355325-0005	Hands down, best place in the area!
356361-0001	Great service
356361-0002	A very well established service with a satisfying outcome.

356705-0001	You were extremely polite and professional.
356705-0002	Very Impressed.
356705-0003	Great electrician.
356920-0001	I called on a Friday at 12:30 complaining of a severe toothache.
356920-0002	Dr. Obina told me that his office closed at noon and that I should call him on Monday.
356920-0003	I had been a patient of Dr. Olbina for 9 years and had spent thousands of dollars on crowns etc.
356920-0004	There are plenty of good dentists in Fernandina.
356920-0005	Don't go to Amelia Gentle Dentistry.
357217-0001	A Definite No
357217-0002	Incompetent servers, kitchen and management.
357217-0003	Expect either undercooked or mushy food and lackluster service.
357217-0004	The investors put big bucks into the building but are clueless about what makes a good dining or bar experience.
357217-0005	Even the least discriminating diner would know not to eat at Sprecher's.
358063-0001	Friendly Efficient and overall great place for people in chronic intractable pain
358063-0002	Great place for people in chronic pain.
358063-0003	Staff is very friendly they treat you like a human being and not just another patient.
358063-0004	Very efficient at treating chronic pain!
358702-0001	Slowest, Unfriendly Sstaff on Weekends
358702-0002	There are three Starbucks locations that I frequent.
358702-0003	I have a bit of experience watching the usual assembly line.
358702-0004	I also understand that weekend staffs are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily Starbucks A-team or even full-time.
358702-0005	But this location has the worst weekend staff I've seen EVER.
359014-0001	Good honest wrok
359014-0002	Harlan provides great service.
359014-0003	He is very knowledgeable and took the time to explain the repairs to me.
359014-0004	The work on my car was done quickly and I felt I could trust his work.
359014-0005	I have nothing but fantastic things to say.
359014-0006	I highly recommend his shop.
359287-0001	High guality pup food at a good price.
359433-0001	Great Place To Use The Fix appliances Plumbing Air Conditioning & Electric Problems.
359433-0002	We have used them for plumbing & A/C and they are affordable and get the work done right.
359433-0003	Great place 5 stars for sure.
359433-0004	Thanks From Bill
360698-0001	Its been a few years since I have been to Ipanema.
360698-0002	But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food (think lots of meat), but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant!
360698-0003	And, I can say, this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond.
360698-0004	Amazing!
360698-0005	Don't let the nondescript building entrance fool you, these are some creative and talented chefs...two thumbs way, way up!
360937-0001	I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery.
360937-0002	I must say, I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge, & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass!
360937-0003	I had a sampler of IPA, Brawler, Love Stout & ESA.
360937-0004	All were awesome, & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers.
360937-0005	After my sampler & sandwich, I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout, I must say I was impressed, with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me, I think this is better, its less dry & smoother!
360937-0006	If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out!
360937-0007	The only negative I have abou this place is the parking!
360937-0008	I left with a case of BRAWLER!!!!!
361316-0001	best quote ever My gate was stuck halfway open so I calledA CLASS Garage Doors Dr Services.
361316-0002	They came to my house in no time and started working on the gate.
361316-0003	They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it.
361316-0004	Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever.
361316-0005	I know that if my garage door needs to be repaired, I will be calling A CLASS Garage Doors
361348-0001	HORRIBLE!!!!!
361348-0002	This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering.
361348-0003	The crust was lopsided, thicker on one side than the other.
361348-0004	It actually had a hole in one of the slices.
361348-0005	There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor.
361348-0006	I know New York pizza and this is not it!!
361348-0007	This was nothing like New York style pizza!!!.
361348-0008	I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment!!
361348-0009	I would not suggest this pizza to anyone!!!
361545-0001	One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry.
361545-0002	Outside of parking being at a premium, especially on discount days, The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it's no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I've been in.
361545-0003	Yes, there are bigger, but bigger isn't necessarily better.
361545-0004	I availed myself of the wash 'n fold service, taking just about a year's worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded, clean clothes in clear plastic bags (I'd originally brought them in, in six large yellow garbage bags).
361545-0005	The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future.
361545-0006	Didn't hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit.
361545-0007	Whereas my answer to the question "Where do you get your laundry done?" used to be, "At the checkout line at WalMart," I can honestly say the answer now is, "At The Laundry Tub."
362073-0001	Great food and nice people very pleasant experience.
363234-0001	Excellent Tattoo Shop
363234-0002	I recently got a tattoo done at Aztec and I could not be happier.
363234-0003	It came out better than I even imagined.
363234-0004	The shop was great, the service was excellent and the employees were fun guys.
363234-0005	I would highly recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a quality tattoo done.
363428-0001	Pam the Pom
363428-0002	Fantastic couple of days.
363428-0003	Breathtaking views and fabulous accommodation.
363428-0004	Nothing too much trouble for Ian, thanks for a great stay.
363482-0001	The food is excellent, but very overpriced.
363482-0002	How do you run a cafe, with no refills on coffee-?
363633-0001	Favorite Restaurant
363633-0002	Best yellow curry that I have ever tasted.
363633-0003	Staff is super friendly and very attentive.
363633-0004	Price is also very reasonable.
363685-0001	Lots of rules, phantom innkeeper, last minute price was worth it.
363685-0002	I called the "207" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up.
363685-0003	I then called the 800 number (which was answered) and inquired about last minute rates.
363685-0004	They had a room with a $99 rate, which I booked.
363685-0005	The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor, but they put us on the 3rd.
363685-0006	The email confirmation (which I read in the car) warned about large suitcases, declaring that we are innkeepers, not longshoreman.
363685-0007	In other words, they do not help with suitcases, but they promise totes to help.
363685-0008	However upon our arrival no one there (the inn was open).
363685-0009	So no totes.
363685-0010	Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M, no exceptions.
363685-0011	Then she was gone.
363685-0012	We returned after 3PM, found no one there, and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room.
363685-0013	Rules in the room: #1) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash.
363685-0014	If they think you've taken a soda from your room home with you, they will charge you $1.50 per can.
363685-0015	They count the cans in the trash to make sure.
363685-0016	#2) If you take the shampoo products home, they will charge you $8 per item.
363685-0017	#) If you want a late checkout, (after 11 AM) they charge you $15 for the first hour, $25 for the second hour, and after 2PM it's a full day charge.
363685-0018	#4) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM.
363685-0019	No earlier and no later.
363685-0020	If you go later, it's all cleaned up.
363685-0021	(By whom, I don't know.
363685-0022	I never saw anyone there.
363685-0023	All these rules are posted in the rooms.)
363685-0024	Snacks: uninspired bread, tea backs, and individual coffee things for a machine that didn't exist.
363685-0025	I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee.
363685-0026	No wine glasses.
363685-0027	Room was clean, but had a weird, dated, sink/stove combo that didn't work.
363685-0028	Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems.
363685-0029	No tub.
363685-0030	The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads, but only one worked.
363685-0031	Don't get the rooms off the two kitchens.
363685-0032	They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything.
363685-0033	Free parking.
363685-0034	I'd go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $99, but I wouldn't pay their rack rate.
363873-0001	Worst Apartments EVER
363873-0002	We lived here for 2 years, the first year or so was okay.
363873-0003	Then, the more power they gave to Linda, the worse the place got.
363873-0004	We were always having our water shut off, there were always people having parties at the pool, even after it was supposed to be closed.
363873-0005	The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11:45 yelling, playing music and do who-knows-what in the dark corners of the pool.
363873-0006	Then, when we moved out, we cleaned the apartment top to bottom, they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees (and we never got our deposit back) and past utilities (that were already paid, we have check numbers and records of this).
363873-0007	Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy, rude people that live there, not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others.
363873-0008	Do not live here, you will regret it!
364454-0001	A very satisfied new customer!
364454-0002	As a very satisfied new customer, I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning.
364454-0003	They are professional, knowledgeable, and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work.
364454-0004	Not only were my wife and I very pleased, but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use, before and after United Air Duct performed their work.
364454-0005	Based on the test results, the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was “excellent”.
365154-0001	Dr. Shady
365154-0002	Kelly hit the nail on the head.
365154-0003	"Dr. Shady" is a jerk.
365154-0004	After the way she spoke to me on my last visit, I will not be returning!!
365154-0005	Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr. Shady.
365154-0006	You have just lost mine.
365154-0007	The next time you feel like being condescending to someone, it is not going to be me!!!!!!
365154-0008	Dr. Shady is inexperienced and prideful.
365154-0009	She probably does not even have 10% of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area.
365154-0010	I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else.
365154-0011	Beautifully written reviews Doctor, but completely UNTRUE.
365630-0001	A+
365630-0002	I would rate Fran pcs an A+ because the price was lower than everyone else, i got my computer back the next day, and the professionalism he showed was great.
365630-0003	He took the time to explain things to me about my computer, i would recommend you go to him.
365630-0004	David
365688-0001	No meat on Burger and too much pepper.
365688-0002	no place to seat
366586-0001	They must have read these reviews and improved!
366586-0002	My husband and I happened in on a whim.
366586-0003	We sat in the front dining area, it was very cozy and pleasant.
366586-0004	Our server was quite attentive and the food was fantastic.
366586-0005	My husband has been a professional chef, so he is a good judge of quality food.
366586-0006	This was a flavorful, enjoyable meal for both of us.
366946-0001	Eulogic
366946-0002	Good place to be on a Sunday Night.
366946-0003	The beers were good, nice choice of beers as well, and as usual the mussels were great, the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs.
366946-0004	Filled up on too much beer and hence cannot comment on the food.
366946-0005	But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern.
366946-0006	If you are a handcraft beer person, this is a fantastic place to be.
367586-0001	Well kept facility with friendly staff.
368431-0001	Ray's pizza : my favorite
368431-0002	Ray's Pizza is just too good.
368431-0003	I wish I could have a slice for every single meal.
368431-0004	Luckily I live very close, so I can abuse it during week-ends...
369087-0001	The Best Service Ever!!
369087-0002	I have never had better service.
369087-0003	My car broke down and roadside towed my vehicle to Sussman Kia.
369087-0004	They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time.
369087-0005	Everyone was pleasant and very helpful.
369087-0006	The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished.
369087-0007	The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle.
369087-0008	I give this dealer an A+!
369087-0009	I will definitely be bringing my car back for service.
369210-0001	When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11, I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager, Gustavo Guerra, in a very friendly and professional manner.
369210-0002	I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda.
369210-0003	Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle.
369210-0004	He told me "no problem, we will match the offer or do better."
369210-0005	Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems.
369210-0006	Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world.
369210-0007	I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus!!!
369210-0008	Excellent customer service!!!
369608-0001	The management and staff are superb.
369608-0002	I worked with Sam Mones who took great care of me.
369608-0003	This is by far the best run dealership in Miami.
369957-0001	beware they will rip u off
371300-0001	Never again
371300-0002	Don't go here unless you want to sit,order,eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes.
371300-0003	You won't even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table.
371300-0004	This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting.
371300-0005	I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it.
371300-0006	Oh, and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas.
371300-0007	Plus the drinks are self service, have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee, juice or water.
371300-0008	Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead.
371492-0001	Excellent service!
371492-0002	I am so glad that we now have a good nail shop on San Mateo Avenue!
371492-0003	No more having to drive to San Francisco for a great mani pedi.
371492-0004	Both Tina and Vicky are excellent.
371492-0005	I will definitely refer my friends and family:)
372582-0001	Prime rib was very tough.
372582-0002	Staff were pleasant.
372582-0003	Won't return.
372665-0001	Is not a service office
372665-0002	This is a delivery office only and does not take walk ins but they do have a blue box out front.
372665-0003	Glad I called before I arrived with my box to ship.
372665-0004	Thought adding a comment would save someone the hassle with a useless trip there.
372903-0001	Fantastic for kids
372903-0002	If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you'll love this zoo.
372903-0003	It's only $10 and in essence just one big petting zoo.
372903-0004	They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots.
372903-0005	We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when (very harshly I might add) grabbing and 'kissed' the goats and lambs.
372903-0006	The animals were all very sweet and patient with her.
372903-0007	Among the animals that were available to touch were pony's, camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH!!!
372903-0008	Wonderful, inexpensive and lots of fun!
374000-0001	GREAT Store GREAT Service!
374000-0002	“This store is great!!
374000-0003	I love walking in and not being hassled.
374000-0004	I was there when they did a free raffle in August and I won a hard drive!
374000-0005	The reason I go back is because the employees are sooooo nice.”
374344-0001	AMAZING
374344-0002	Absoul is the greatest donair man on the planet.
374344-0003	Highly recommended.
374344-0004	If you enjoy amazing things, you must go to World's Finest Donair.
374344-0005	Lest you be lame!!!
374344-0006	I give this place 11/10.
374344-0007	3 thumbs up.
374344-0008	Bon appetit!
374604-0001	I've never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before, but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels (whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs) I would now not recommend this business to anybody.
374604-0002	If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired!
374604-0003	Nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives!
376320-0001	First trip to Canada
376320-0002	I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience.
376320-0003	I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time.
376320-0004	This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time.
376320-0005	I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip.
376320-0006	I found the hotel to be amazingly clean, not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises.
376320-0007	From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation.
376320-0008	I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves.
376320-0009	I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection.
376320-0010	Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners.
376320-0011	Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable.
376503-0001	I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel.
376503-0002	Liberty construction shows up and it's two guys...all I get is 100% sales pitch "We're the best...we're number 50 so we must be doing something right...look at all these certificates that say we're great".
376503-0003	Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted, all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there.
376503-0004	Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service.
376503-0005	I'm glad I trusted my gut and didn't get sucked into doing business with them.
376503-0006	Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right.
377347-0001	Craft Wonderland with History
377347-0002	My first visit was so fun yesterday.
377347-0003	I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things.
377347-0004	I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too.
377347-0005	I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts.
377347-0006	The owner, Jean, has been there 31 years!
377347-0007	What a history.
377347-0008	She is a super sweet, lovable and well-informed woman with a great sense of humor.
377347-0009	I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl.
377347-0010	This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter.
377347-0011	By the way, Salmagundi (the store name) means something like smorgasbord; potpourri; motley; variety; mixed bag; miscellaneous assortment; mixture, a variety of many kinds of things.
377347-0012	Great name for a great store!
377347-0013	Shop Local!
377347-0014	Barbara Quimba 1/30/10
379701-0001	VERYYYY!!!! VERYYY!! Good auto repair men.
379701-0002	Do the job honest and quickly as possible.
379701-0003	Would 100% recomend to others for a great service.
379701-0004	Thank You Barrys Auto Tech!
380048-0001	Fantastic Nova Scotia Cottage
380048-0002	We had a fantastic time.
380048-0003	Such a relaxing atmosphere and inspiring architecture.
380048-0004	Sand Hill park was a great beach...
380048-0005	Nice warm water.
380048-0006	Thank-You for sharing your cottage!
381455-0001	Are you kidding me?
381455-0002	I don't get it.
381455-0003	Spongy and sweet bread (microwaved?), heartless salsa, tiny dogs...
381455-0004	You order at the counter and there is a space for tip on your credit card receipt.
381455-0005	The dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude.
381455-0006	If this is the best that Tucson has to offer, I am outta here...
382073-0001	FANTASTIC STORE!!!
382073-0002	I came upon this store as the building caught my eye.
382073-0003	It's located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building, by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway.
382073-0004	The store was decorated with furnishings & accessories.
382073-0005	The friendly crew working was great & very helpful.
382073-0006	This store is what Colorado is all about.
382073-0007	Also, I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great!
382073-0008	It's durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon!
382257-0001	Easiest Time I ever had purchasing a car!
382257-0002	Excellent service, Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch.
382257-0003	Very kind and reliable.
382257-0004	I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service.
382257-0005	I have since purchased two cars from this dealership, The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard.
382257-0006	Both were excellent sales men who put my needs first.
384229-0001	great tmobile service
384229-0002	I was with verizon and I checked my service with tmobile and it was great so I thought I would try tmobile.
384229-0003	It turned out being very good quality tmobile service and I was happy with the new tmobile phone.
385281-0001	Great first experience.
385281-0002	I'm 22, and my hairdresser was great (and not "old" like one of the reviews says) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to.
385281-0003	She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly.
385281-0004	She recommended products but absolutely didn't pressure me to buy.
385281-0005	It's a cute place with a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere.
385281-0006	I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut.
385281-0007	Oh!
385281-0008	And students get $5 off, can't argue with that.
385436-0001	This is the best Mediterranean Restaurant in the West Valley, I have friend who drive from central Phx to come here.
388121-0001	Too many kids, too many knifings, too many taserings.
388799-0001	Worth Every Penny
388799-0002	My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night, and our experience was amazing.
388799-0003	Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection, and was presented perfectly.
388799-0004	The asparagus, seared tuna, and lobster tail were the best we ever had.
388799-0005	Then the desserts came, and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had.
388799-0006	I will sum it up with, it was worth every penny!
389136-0001	great!
389136-0002	I go Disco dancing and Cheerleading.
389136-0003	Its fab!
389136-0004	so goand get dancing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
389136-0005	By samantha Fox
389298-0001	Great quality doors and great quality people!
389298-0002	The door is easy to use and it keeps the cold out during the winter.
389298-0003	The sales staff and the installation staff were all easy to get along with.
389298-0004	I highly recommend Garage Pros to my friends.
389498-0001	This place has done a great job of taking care of the usual maintenance on my hooptie.
389498-0002	I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker...and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me..."the inspection guy isn't here today"....for example.
389498-0003	Today I went into Kwik Kar and there were two cars in front of me for inspection...but I was still out of there pretty quick...barely had time to read a chapter in my book.
390330-0001	I appreciate the quick, good service and the reasonable prices and will definitely use American Pride Irrigation & Landscaping again.
391012-0001	Watch out for your wallet
391012-0002	Watch out for your wallet!
391012-0003	This company is overpriced for their services.
391012-0004	They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise.
391012-0005	On a recent event quote that I had done, they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition.
391012-0006	The craziest part is that they aren't even based locally at the city I'm in- they just have 'teams' in areas through the country.
391012-0007	I've spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them.
391012-0008	Be warned- they'll ltake you for everything they can.
392826-0001	Extremely greasy.
392826-0002	Hit or miss on the service.
392826-0003	My fries weren't fully cooked last time I went there.
392826-0004	Pretty spendy for really not great quality

394662-0002	I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great.
394662-0003	They had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty.
394662-0004	I enjoy going there although i've only been there once, i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here.
394662-0005	i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality.

395218-0001	Tire Gooroo
395218-0002	David Bundren is the Tire GooRoo.
395640-0001	Don't bother.
395640-0002	It's impossible to understand how this place has survived.
396046-0001	Worst experience ever like a sardine can and the bartender downstairs is the rudest person I have ever met.
396046-0002	DONt Go here
396874-0001	Restored my faith in Mechaincs.
396874-0002	I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should.
396874-0003	I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal.
396874-0004	They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more.
396874-0005	The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning.
396874-0006	I cannot say enough about this place.
396874-0007	They have restored my faith in Mechanics.
396874-0008	Do yourself a favor, call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again..
396880-0001	I guess you get what you pay for.
396880-0002	I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend, so we asked for a single queen bed.
396880-0003	We got there, and we were treated to the free "upgrade" of a room with two double beds.
396880-0004	Since they consider this an upgrade, they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room.
396880-0005	Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door....right next to the ice machine.
396880-0006	We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room.
396880-0007	When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English, they moved our room, but we still did not receive the single queen we had "reserved"
397066-0001	Great pet care
397066-0002	I have used Just Like Family several times now and they have provided great care for my two dogs.
397066-0003	Lynda is professional and has great compassion for animals.
397066-0004	The real testament is not in how much she likes your animals but how much they like her.
397066-0005	I highly recommend her.
398152-0001	Con Garage
398152-0002	I brought my car in for a simple emissions test.
398152-0003	I guess they figured me for an easy mark, and tried to explain that my car wouldn't pass unless I replaced a hose.
398152-0004	Ten minutes later, I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors.
398152-0005	If you're a fan of herpes, being ripped off, and child molesters, this is the garage for you.
398152-0006	If not, go somewhere else.
398243-0001	Great work and honest establishment!
398243-0002	I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership, but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn't seem cost effective anymore.
398243-0003	I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times.
398243-0004	I had hear great things about Phet and G&G Automotive so I decided to give him a try.
398243-0005	The service was excellent and personable.
398243-0006	He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work.
398243-0007	The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places, plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car.
398243-0008	Also, a week after the work, Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount.
398243-0009	That is just unheard of these days!
398243-0010	I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here, but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around.
398243-0011	He is my mechanic going forward!
399348-0001	Friendly, clean and excellent location
399348-0002	The staff was very helpful, and gave us good advice on day and night time activities.
399348-0003	Common room was comfortable and clean, very good room to read or relax. –
399348-0004	A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9:30am; yummy fresh Parisian croissants.
399348-0005	Comfortable and clean beds, a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out, but we didn't mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out!
399348-0006	The location is really stellar!
399348-0007	It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping.
399348-0008	It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza, Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market.
399348-0009	We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again.
