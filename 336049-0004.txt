Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape's or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyone s attention .
