It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentine s and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
